       "  'comment': 'Help Wanted: Tales of On The Job Terror from Evil Jester Press is a fun and scary read. This book is edited by Peter Giglio and has short stories by Joe McKinney, Gary Brandner, Henry Snider and many more. As if work wasnt already scary enough, this book gives you more reasons to be scared. Help Wanted is an excellent anthology that includes some great stories by some master storytellers.\\nOne of the stories includes Agnes: A Love Story by David C. Hayes, which tells the tale of a lawyer named Jack who feels unappreciated at work and by his wife so he starts a relationship with a photocopier. They get along well until the photocopier starts wanting the lawyer to kill for it. The thing I liked about this story was how the author makes you feel sorry for Jack. His two co-workers are happily married and love their jobs while Jack is married to a paranoid alcoholic and he hates and works at a job he cant stand. You completely understand how he can fall in love with a copier because he is a lonely soul that no one understands except the copier of course.\\nAnother story in Help Wanted is Work Life Balance by Jeff Strand. In this story a man works for a company that starts to let their employees do what they want at work. It starts with letting them come to work a little later than usual, then the employees are allowed to hug and kiss on the job. Things get really out of hand though when the company starts letting employees carry knives and stab each other, as long as it doesnt interfere with their job. This story is meant to be more funny then scary but still has its scary moments. Jeff Strand does a great job mixing humor and horror in this story.\\nAnother good story in Help Wanted: On The Job Terror is The Chapel Of Unrest by Stephen Volk. This is a gothic horror story that takes place in the 1800s and has to deal with an undertaker who has the duty of capturing and embalming a ghoul who has been eating dead bodies in a graveyard. Stephen Volk through his use of imagery in describing the graveyard, the chapel and the clothes of the time, transports you into an 1800s gothic setting that reminded me of Bram Stokers Dracula.\\nOne more story in this anthology that I have to mention is Expulsion by Eric Shapiro which tells the tale of a mad man going into a office to kill his fellow employees. This is a very short but very powerful story that gets you into the mind of a disgruntled employee but manages to end on a positive note. Though there were stories I didnt like in Help Wanted, all in all its a very good anthology. I highly recommend this book ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Magoon, K. (2012). Fire in the streets. New York: Simon and Schuster/Aladdin. 336 pp. ISBN: 978-1-4424-2230-8. (Hardcover); $16.99.\\nKekla Magoon is an author to watch (http://www.spicyreads.org/Author_Videos.html- scroll down). One of my favorite books from 2007 is Magoons The Rock and the River. At the time, I mentioned in reviews that we have very few books that even mention the Black Panther Party, let alone deal with them in a careful, thorough way. Fire in the Streets continues the story Magoon began in her debut book. While her familys financial fortunes drip away, not helped by her mothers drinking and assortment of boyfriends, the Panthers provide a very real respite for Maxie. Sam is still dealing with the death of his brother. Maxies relationship with Sam only serves to confuse and upset them both. Her friends, Emmalee and Patrice, are slowly drifting away. The Panther Party is the only thing that seems to make sense and she basks in its routine and consistency. She longs to become a full member of the Panthers and constantly battles with her Panther brother Raheem over her maturity and ability to do more than office tasks. Maxie wants to have her own gun. When Maxie discovers that there is someone working with the Panthers that is leaking information to the government about Panther activity, Maxie investigates. Someone is attempting to destroy the only place that offers her shelter. Maxie is determined to discover the identity of the traitor, thinking that this will prove her worth to the organization. However, the truth is not simple and it is filled with pain. Unfortunately we still do not have many teen books that deal substantially with the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Black Panther Party, and the social problems in Chicago that lead to the civil unrest. Thankfully, Fire in the Streets lives up to the standard Magoon set with The Rock and the River. Readers will feel like they have stepped back in time. Magoons factual tidbits add journalistic realism to the story and only improves the atmosphere. Maxie has spunk. Readers will empathize with her Atlas-task of trying to hold onto her world. Fire in the Streets belongs in all middle school and high school libraries. While readers are able to read this story independently of The Rock and the River, I strongly urge readers to read both and in order. Magoons recognition by the Coretta Scott King committee and the NAACP Image awards are NOT mistakes!',\n",

It was a little difficult for me to get into it in the beginning but about mid-way through the book, I became really engaged and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to the main character Caitlyn an her companions that help her get away from the deadly hunt. It's a little bit of dystopian world of United States being divided into two different worlds and it's hard to say which one is worse. Caitlyn is a product of genetic experimentation and that's why she's being hunted. It's a short, quick read. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'During the early part of the twentieth century, female adolescents began to challenge the idea of Victorian moral standards in their pursuit for autonomy. In their attempt to redefine their role in society, young women often sought work and amusements outside the family unit resulting in pre-marital sexual relations with men, unplanned pregnancies and criminal activity. Wayward girls were often sentenced to a period of reform within one of two institutions presented in Ruth Alexanders book, The Girl Problem. In this in-depth study of girls who got into trouble, Alexander sets out to identify the motives behind their behavior and examine how state-mandated reform was viewed from the perspective of those who were incarcerated as well as those who enforced Victorian standards of female decency. \\nMuch has been written during the latter half of the twentieth century examining female adolescent change and the idea of new womanhood. Most of this material centers on emerging patterns of change within the female adolescent culture during the early half of the twentieth century. The Girl Problem fits nicely within this genre of feminist study. While most of the contemporary literature on this topic focuses on troubled females within the United States as a whole, Alexander chooses to narrow her research down to focus on a specific geographic area. By doing so, she is able to provide an accurate representation of the typical female adolescent struggling to reinvent a new sense of self in areas of New York. \\nAlexander makes use of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, but focuses much of her attention on the unpublished case files of one hundred inmates who had been admitted to the Bedford Hills and Albion reformatories. By doing so, Alexander is able to reveal the various methodologies employed by the reformatories as well as allow the reader to glimpse into the personal lives of several of the girls in her sample. She includes photographs from the respective institutions representing daily life at the reformatories as well as copies of psychological examinations given at Albion at the time of admittance. Alexander uses social geography to examine the role it played in the development of early twentieth century female rebellion by limiting her area of research to a geographic region that was known for its increased population of immigrant, African American and low income families. Although admitting that she could not achieve a statistically representative study of inmate populations due to not having access to a complete set of reformatory records from both institutions, Alexander makes a valiant attempt at choosing case files that were heavy with correspondence as well as being representative of young women of different races, ethnicities and criminal backgrounds. \\nAlexander brings to life a society in which an unstable economy mixed with growing tension in the household resulted in young women participating in the life of the street in a manifestly unguarded manner. The author argues that in demanding a return to feminine standards, parents and reformatory administrators often produced in their daughters increased displays of rebellion rather than acquiescence. Alexander emphasizes the influence that an unstable family unit had on the reluctance of young females to conform. She provides evidence of correspondence between families and inmates that was often in need of censoring by reformatory personnel to weed out negative comments or discouraging subjects. A downside to this type of censorship, Alexander argues, is that it offered young women and their families no opportunity to discuss or mend their troubled relations. By describing the dissolution of families through economic hardship as well as the challenges that faced young women while institutionalized, Alexander allows the reader to better understand the factors contributing to increased female rebellion. \\nThe author attempts to maintain neutrality throughout the book, defending the incorrigible girls that were sent to the reformatories as well as their families and those who were in charge of bringing the girls back to a state of being that better represented the Victorian standards of the day. However, she often portrays the young women in her sample as victims of a society changed by urbanization and industrialization. She gives numerous examples of how little families contributed to the moral growth of their daughters as well as the limitations faced by the reformatories while attempting to reinstate feminine virtue. \\nAlexanders rich descriptions of how desperate female adolescents were for social change allow the reader to develop a feeling of empathy for these girls and identify with their plight. She argues that one often focuses primarily on the delinquent behavior of young females during the early twentieth century rather than allowing their actions to be representative of the social changes occurring in the United States during that time. The Girl Problem provides an insight into the personal lives of young women who, in the process of reconstructing a new sense of self, fell victim to a society that was still stuck in Victorian modes of thought. Alexander excels not only in her explicit identification of the roles reformatories played in dealing with the girl problem, but in her attempt to explain how race, gender, ethnicity and familial disadvantage worked together to contribute to the delinquency of young women in early twentieth century New York.

Having won the war by getting the bomb first, Germany settles into the uneasy role of world super-power, squared off against a prosperous America. Goebbel's muses about the death of Hitler, wonders where Germany is headed, and unwittingly becomes the pawn in a plot to further the Nazi agenda. There is a lot of interesting speculation on various political issues, which I found very interesting, and an action-adventure denouement, which I found a little rushed.

As the story opened, I immediately didn't like Anna - I found her and her actions annoying. Even as she got on the road with her grandmother Goldie, on a trip cross-country to return a set of Japanese prints to her grandmother's former friends, I continued to dislike Anna. I just could not seem to understand why Anna did and said the things she did, and I was nearly ready to set this book aside. \\nUntil the story shifted to Goldie's time in early 1940s San Francisco as a shopgirl. Goldie's story was fascinating and it was at this point that I could not put this book down. It was almost as if it was a book within a book. I loved the descriptions of Goldie's small-town girl reactions to San Francisco, and her relationships with the Nakamura family and others she met though her job at Feld's department store. I found Goldie refreshing and honest. And I didn't guess at any of the twists in her story, which just added to my enjoyment. \\nThe ending was sweet, if a bit disappointing. I think I would have rated this book higher if it had been just Goldie's story, without Anna. Goldie's story: 5 stars. Anna's story: 2 stars. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"The Discovery of Heaven is a novel of ideas on a large scale, sprawling across science, religion, architecture, politics, philosophy and more. Though intellectual in its preoccupations, it is never didactic: ideas are integrated with the plot and characters and never allowed to get in the way of the story. The overall tone is also light-hearted, though it is not a comic novel. And Mulisch never pushes any of the ideas too far  at least, none of the science was a problem for me, though I'm pretty sensitive to misuse of scientific ideas. I especially appreciated his reflection upon the nature of language and the necessity of words to creation, initiating us into Mulischs formally personal world. The book eagerly invites serious philosophical questions about the possibility of ever creating anything truly novel. This is one of the few novels that approach the level of Musil or Canetti in my experience. That is as high praise as I can give. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'In order to understand the context of the book, you must understand the historical setting. This story is a fictionalized account of the first Caribbean Pirate shipwreck on Cuba in the 1500s. Most of the characters are actual people from history. The only fictional character is Quebrado. \\nIn the beginning of the novel, we meet Quebrado, a slave aboard Bernardino de Talaveras shipthe first pirate ship of the Caribbean. At this point, Bernardino has captured Alonso de Ojeda and is holding him hostage on the ship as well. Then the hurricane hits. The entire ship is destroyed, and all the surviving crew members have to fight to find shelter on a mysterious island (Cuba). \\nQuebrado is unique because he can speak two languages, one of which is the language of the naturals on the island. He is instantly welcomed by the tribe. Eventually Bernardino and Ojeda find Quebrado living among the tribe. The remainder of the story focuses on Quebrados attempts to find his new identity in the world and forgive his former captors. This is not the only story taking place within the novel, however. Being told simultaneously is the story of Narido and Caucubu, two lovers who are forbidden to be together. \\nPersonally, I was only slightly interested in this novel. I think my lack of knowledge and interest in the historical context that the story was based on added to my half-hearted reading. The prose was well written and did carry a nice plot, and there were beautiful metaphors used throughout the novel. Also, I felt that there was a nice message hidden within the short text. Maybe Im wrong, but I picked up on a hint of self-acceptance in the books final poems. The final words in the novel are I am whole, which is a pretty significant, considering Quebrados struggles.',\n",

A ghost in the form of a dead man\\'s suit will be yet another thing to add to the collection.\\nExcept that this ghost is real. And out to kill him and anyone that will offer him security or comfort. This includes Georgia, his much-younger goth-obsessed girlfriend of 9-months who is in for the the full fight.\\nJoe Hill\\'s ghost story gets off to a quick start where he builds a claustrophobic road trip where even you\\'ll wonder if taking the ghost\\'s early advice to simply kill themselves early on would have been the right move. Hill\\'s strength comes in great visualization; dream sequences a described in vivid detail without droning on for pages and each setting is given its own unique atmosphere. There are no generic dark and dank basements for our characters to traipse through - Hill can even take a shiny new subdivision done up in ice-cream-shop colors and turn it into a place fit for a vengeful ghost.\\nThe fright factor is largely tilted towards thriller and it reads much faster than its nearly 400 pages implies. It\\'s a very worthwhile read and one that you\\'ll find yourself staying up for \"one more chapter\" just to see what happens next. ',\n",

Boyd lays out the story of Logan Mountstuart in the form of the character's journals, completed with varying regularity throughout his life, stretching from his days at public school at the end of the First World War, through his days at Oxford in the early 1920s and various dalliances during the Spanish Civil War, and World War Two, a spell running a gallery in New York in the 1950s and 1960s, academia in West Africa in the late 1960s and then penury back home in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nThe reminiscences are liberally peppered with pen portraits of the people whom Mountstuart met, including Hemingway, Evelyn Waugh and, in more sinister circumstances, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\\nBoyd is, as ever, master of his material and the pace never lags, and the reader is wholly immersed in the world of Mountstuart.

       "  'comment': 'It seems that most murderers have the spotlight for a few months, or a few years, and then they fade into obscurity as something else takes their place. That is exactly what happened to the murderers profiled in this book; at one time, they terrorized and titillated the American public, but for whatever reasons, no one remembers them today.\\nFrom black widows to bluebeards to family slayers to those who killed for a grudge or no discernible reason at all, Harold Schechter details the lives and crimes of those whose deeds had been notorious in their times. Many spawned murder ballads; some even inspired best-selling books. A few were molded into chilling movie characters. But none are widely remembered today.\\nI found the book interesting. Schechter has a readable and engrossing way of writing, although sometimes the same phrases kept popping up in the profiles (I kept getting the Styx song \"Renegade\" in my head from the numerous times that \"the jig is up\" was used). He also supplements the profiles with information about the times or what other important events were occurring. He also includes a lot of lyrics to murder ballads, which is interesting. Altogether, recommended to those who are into true crime. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'This collection of 15 essays is \"from the magazine for Star Trek fans.\" Oh my, I was so very, very young and so very much a trekkie when I bought this book, and it somehow survived several purges of my bookshelves over the years--when I had to be ruthless because my books multiplied like tribbles. \\nBack when this book was published in 1985, The Search for Spock had just come out; the opening article was \"A Speculation on Star Trek IV.\" The second article, \"Star Trek Fans: The Blind Spot\" was all about how fans had to accept recasting or Star Trek would die. Not only was the Reboot not on the horizon, it didn\\'t occur to the author the Trek universe could expand and thrive by other means; Star Trek: The Next Generation wouldn\\'t air for two more years. Fanfic was found only in fanzines, not online. The article on it \"The Three Foot Pit and Other Stories\" didn\\'t even mention slash. Had it not yet surfaced or was Kirk/Spock still a deep, dark secret? And in terms of the writing advice, well, I\\'ve seen better essays online from fan fiction authors since. Carpenter\\'s \"\\'Approaching Evil\\' and \\'Love in Star Trek\\'-- a Rebuttal\" had Ayn Rand\\'s fingerprints all over it. It\\'s obviously an application of her philosophy of Objectivism to Trek. What annoys me so much is the author doesn\\'t have the guts to identify the sources of his argument, probably because he knows many would then dismiss him without a hearing. \"And the Children Shall Sue\" was just not an interesting parody--renaming Kirk \"Jerk\" doesn\\'t pass for wit with me. If I had a favorite article, it was \"All About Chapel\" which does well in giving dimension to an underrated character through small moments in canon. But that\\'s not enough--it\\'s finally going into the get-rid-of box, because despite some lingering nostalgia, no this isn\\'t a keeper. ',\n",

Soon after, she finds herself floating towards heaven, which looks just like the mall where her parents work and where she has spent a good deal of her life.\\nShe is led to the Lost and Found, where she is given a bag of items: items that she has taken home from the mall during her lifetime, and each item takes her on a journey to her past.

It is written in verse, but if that's not your thing don't let it stop you. About a quarter of the way through I stopped noticing the verse because I was so engrossed in the story, and Wendy Mass does a wonderful job making the reader feel for Tessa, even if she's not always the most likeable person.

       "  'comment': \"I like detectives. Not all of them by any means, but I like them. Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Lord Peter Wimsey, Inspector Grant, and most recently, Inspector Alleyn. Any new-to-me Alleyn mystery is a cause for rejoicing, the donning of a smoking jacket and the putting up of an 'occupied' sign on my (non-existent) study door. Lord Peter is perhaps my favorite but Alleyn comes close.\\nI'm not sure how many Alleyns I've read so far; my wild guess is about ten. They have, at this point, started to get a bit formulaic, although the characters are always a delight. Night at the Vulcan was interesting partly because it varied the formula a bit and also because Alleyn managed to solve the mystery in a single night.\\nThe story starts out with a young woman named Martyn Tarne who intended to audition for a small part in a play but arrives too late. She obviously has no money and is at the end of her rope. She manages to wing a job as the leading lady's dresser. They very quickly notice Martyn's strong resemblance to the leading man, Adam Poole. A complicated situation results. Of course there is a murder--someone no one likes or will miss very much. Alleyn arrives on the scene accompanied by Fox and Mike Lamprey, from A Surfeit of Lampreys. And of course the murderer is caught, although not quite in the usual way.\\nNight at the Vulcan is one of Marsh's more clever mysteries. The cast of characters is not as appealing as they often are, but the two main characters remain sympathetic. All in all, it was an enjoyable book and satisfying book. \",\n",

The second gave us a society of dragons integrated into China. In a world-building sense, this book can\\'t match that--there\\'s no further development or surprises in terms of Temeraire\\'s or Laurence\\'s character--but it\\'s fully as engrossing a read and engaging an adventure. The last book took us to China, this one to Turkey and Germany of the Napoleonic era, and its part of the book\\'s virtue to make me believe I visited those places--or at least what they would be like had dragons been part of the picture.

       "  'comment': 'A good work of non-fiction should be reader-friendly, full of well-organized information and annotated in a way that does not interfere with the flow of the narrative. Adding maps, photographs, and a couple thoughtful appendices will turn a good work of non-fiction into an excellent reference. Put all these elements together with a story-tellers flair for drama and an enthusiasts love of the subject matter, and the result is a great read, like On Hallowed Ground, the Story of Arlington National Cemetery. Robert Poole leads us from the early days of the American Civil War, when Robert E. Lees home above the Potomac River was occupied by Union forces; to the first military burials on the grounds of the former plantation; to the dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown in 1932; to September 11, 2001, when the peace of Arlington National Cemetery was shattered by the impact of a 757 slamming into the adjacent Pentagon. Along the way he relates innumerable heart-touching stories with the skill of a novelist, and imparts fascinating bits of factual information in full historical context. If you have visited Arlington, reading this book will add a dimension of understanding to the experience. If you havent, it will make you wish to. ',\n",

The book centers on a family, and opens with preparations for a wedding. During the course of the novel we are given many stories surrounding the family and its members. The story is narrated through the eyes of college graduate Zaki, but it becomes clear that the heart of the family is its strong women.\\nThis was my first dose of Pakistani literature, and overall I was fascinated by the elements of cultural in particular the influence of traditional Islamic values and how they clashed with the metropolitan city of Lahore. I admit, at times it was confusing, keeping the characters straight and not getting lost amongst the dozens of subplots. The Wishmaker is a lot to take in, but it is a unique and successful depiction of the evolution of todays Pakistani lifestylean impressive debut. ',\n",

The woman talked about how awful some of the nurses would treat her, bad things that they would say and how ungentle they would treat her believing she could not feel anything. She felt pain, heard things going on around her. It was awful what she went through by some of the aides and nurses, but some were very caring and gentle to her. It is a great story and will make you think twice about whether or not a person knows anything or feels anything if they are in a coma.. I think \"everyone\" should read this book, especially if they have a loved one that could possible end up in a coma due to an illness like the one this woman had Guillian-Barr. I really enjoyed reading this book. It made me cry at times and at other times I wanted to punch some of the people that were so mean and cruel. Even though it has been a very long time since I read this I will never forget it. It is a great read from beginning to end. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I have been ploughing through these this last few weeks. Ploughing being an intentioned pun. I have told sometimes of the sequencing of a body, of a suspect, of a result if it was too obvious. Well here we have the body in the very first chapter. It works wondorously well. Throughout the series we have the vocabulary that Cadfael uses lend further to the depth that these stories give the times. Perhaps not what really took place, but giving the entire series a character.\\nWe see that well fleshed out here. Cadfael and Hugh the Sheriff embark on solving the mystery and whilst doing so we have our red herrings, we have our Peters provided romance, and this time out we have a conclusion that is not so obvious, but is well within the realm of the possible that it satisfies. Certainly, given some of the faults that could have taken place and have had with the previous few novels, this was a solid novel and well worth the time.\\nWe find that the civil war provides some background to the mystery but not as in the past books that without it, there would be no story. We also see a good mix of the perception of the church, and how the church interacts with its flock. This story provides a good return on the investment with Cadfael.\\nAfter the Abbey does a deal with another monastery that results in a local field being exchanged, Cadfael is on hand to oversee the first day's work to it when the body is uncovered. As it was previously worked by a new brother to the Abbey of Saint Peter and Paul, suspicion falls on this good man that it is the wife he left behind before taking orders. From there we have a well paced haul to the truth. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"This book was written by Ed, the youngest brother of Richard, and in many ways, is best seen from his perspective as a little brother who respected and admired his better-known counterpart. Nixon disclaims any revelation vis-a-vis Watergate but he states that Dick thought it better to resign than to have the country experience the trauma of a constitutional crisis. He further claims that he and his brother never discussed one of the most important issues of the twentieth-century presidency. He postulates, and implies blame of course, on Nixon's most zealous supporters. He suspects that Nixon's underlings committed acts in his name but without his foreknowledge nor approval. Since Ed has no intimate knowledge nor any evidence for what he describes he is best seen as a devoted younger brother who is understandably trying to protect his family's good name.\\nOn the other hand, the book, if not revelatory, has merit as an insider's look into the Nixon family. And in this regard, the book has substance. Ed provides a glimpse into the family balance of power between the Nixon brother's parents. In this, Ed is more revealing and worthwhile. \\nRichard the politician tried to balance the dual heritage he inherited from his parents. From his pious Quaker mother, Richard gained a desire for genuine world peace based on the strength of the U.S. On his father's side, Richard sought to emphasize personal responsibility and limited government. \\nMost revealingly in his book (a summary is included in an Appendix), Beyond Peace, Richard provided a prescription for America which is a balance of the somewhat contradictory tendencies of his parents. Nonetheless, Peace is relevant application to many of America's problems in a period of the post-Obama inauguration.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Holy wild, rollicking adventure story! Ive wanted to set sail with Orm Tostesom and his crew ever since I picked up the NYRB reissue of the book that was originally published in 1944, a few years ago. It finally rose to the top of my book pile and I couldnt be happier with the result. The fact that it was Frans Bengtssons only work of fiction drips with irony. Here you have a yarn spinner extraordinaire and he produces one work of fiction? Wheres the fairness in that?\\nBengtsson tells the story of Red Orms life from the time, as a boy, when he was abducted by the Vikings and forced to row from the north of Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. We continue to follow him on a total of three voyages during the course of many years around the year 1000 A.D. Along the way Orm ends up with his own crew and captains his own ship, takes on King Ethelred of England, and the Moors, learns the history of the Jews from one called Solomon, makes the acquaintance of Harald Bluetooth, King of Sweden, and falls in love with his daughter, accumulates a large fortune, becomes a Christian and a family man and goes on a treasure hunt. Whew! Non-stop action on every page, pitched battles, bloody skirmishes and high adventure, Bengtsson has filled his book with humor and utterly complicated characters and locales and a wonderful hero who will remain in my mind for a long time. Most importantly there was wild, wild fun on every page.\\nThe books opening paragraph will give you an idea of the flavor of the narrative, which I found totally engaging:\\nAlong the coast the people lived together in villages, partly to be sure of food, that they might not depend entirely on the luck of their own catch, and partly for greater security; for ships rounding the Skanian peninsula often sent marauding parties ashore, both in the spring, to replenish cheaply their stock of fresh meat for the westward voyage, and in the winter, if they were returning empty-handed from unsuccessful wars. Horns would be blown during the night when raiders were thought to have landed, so that the neighbors might come to the assistance of those attacked; and the stay-at-homes of a good village would occasionally even capture a ship or two for themselves, from strangers who had not been sufficiently prudent, and so have fine prizes to show the wanderers of the village when the long ships came home for their winter rest.\\nSo if youre looking for a book you can sink into and be completely immersed in and an exciting narrative that takes you on long voyages and allows you to get to know the Vikings of old, this book is just the ticket. Remember to put your seatbelt on because you are in for quite a ride. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I think I really liked this book. I hate to say it, because it sounds like much of what I had previously heard that threw me off more than anything, but it was like a dream. Well, like a dream on TV or film anyway. What I mean is that there seems to be all this going on that I could not quite grasp, so much that even how I feel about the novel is hard to pin down.\\nI have to imagine this is partly intentional. Much of what really clicks is shrouded in the beginning and it does not really kick it into high gear until late, and there is so much to it and so many powerful issues, be it science and progress or society or knowledge or love and friendship that it pulls you in and spins you around. \\nThe writing is unassuming and while some facets of the characters and the very conceit of the story sometimes wears thin from a practical perspective, the astute reader will catch an undercurrent of something brilliant.\\nI guess this is to say don't expect to fall in love with the characters by page 5 and don't expect to know what is going on even if you do figure out what it is. It is both obvious and not, bear it out.\\nFinally, I guess I can call it a very successful book based on the idea that a book's purpose is said by some to be getting the reader to continue to the finish. This one seemed to falter at times, but ended with me anxious to read it again. A rare quality \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"The Possessed, the second volume in L. J. Smith's Dark Visions trilogy, picks up right where the first left off. Precog Kaitlyn Fairchild has fled the mysterious Zetes Institute along with fellow students Anna, Lewis, Sexy Boy #1 (also known as Rob), and Sexy Boy #2 (also known as Gabriel). This is a road trip novel, tracing our band of teen psychics up the west coast in search of a mysterious white house that has been appearing in Kaitlyn's dreams. The pacing is quick here, effective, and the scene building rich. The teenagers have several surreal, and frankly frightening, encounters with the supernatural on their journey. However, the novel feels even slighter than most sophomore entries in trilogies and the problems with racial stereotyping are even deeper than they were in the first book.In my review of the first novel, I mentioned Smith's over reliance on stereotyping in building minor characters. In that volume, Lewis is depicted as essentially asexual and a tech wiz, while Anna Whiteraven speaks to animals and hangs masks on her wall. The depictions of Native Americans become even more generalized here: Anna's mother is somehow up on Inuit language and culture (despite not being Inuit), and talks about tribal leaders. Meanwhile, we visit the house of a Latino family, which, of course, is decorated by virgin statues. On the one hand, I'm glad to see cultural artifacts present in an otherwise very white world. On the other, Smith's depictions of these characters never go any deeper than that.But this is a minor complaint with the first three-quarters of the book. As the psychics make their way up the coast, they encounter menacing ghosts, apparitions, psychic slugs, and telepathically-projected angst. Meanwhile, Kaitlyn is torn between her blossoming feelings towards psychic vampire Gabriel and her familiar affection for healer Rob. I loved these scenes; Smith is a very visually-oriented writer, and I could easily imagine the road trip depicted here--with all of its sexual tension, intrigue, and terror--projected on a big screen. Though the journey is fairly intimate thanks to its limited cast, it's also quite cinematic.But Smith rushes the book's conclusion in order to set us up for the next volume, and in doing so hastily adds several flat minor characters. The tensions all fizzle out by the end, and we're left feeling aimless. Yes, we're supposed to just pick up the next book (and I did, of course), but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have some sense of satisfaction by this novel's conclusion, particularly when the lead-up is so much more engaging. \",\n",

This race is known as intermorph, and those like our own are schizomorph. A teenage hover bike gang steals a space craft and finds themselves on a troubled intermorph planet where they must band together and fight as warriors against demons, internal enemies, and a neighboring aggressive schizomorph race.\\nWriting that reads as if it was written by a 10 year old (I can only hope that this is the case). Perhaps this could be overlooked and the author encouraged to keep trying if the basic storyline wasn\\'t so incredibly offensive. A race of just women absolutely can be a creative way to explore gender and sexuality, and I\\'ve seen it done well by famous feminist scifi authors. This is not done well, however. The intermorphs are all either brunettes or blondes with the brunettes fulfilling the traditional male role, and the blondes fulfilling the traditional female role. Everything about how they interact is a carbon copy of a traditional patriarchy. Just because both genders have vaginas doesn\\'t make how the brunettes treat the blondes less offensive. I also was incredibly disturbed at how the female main characters talked about the male schizomorphs. They referred to them as \"it\" and as animals. Even beards on men were degraded and feared. It\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen a book somehow manage to be both misogynistic and misandrist. This in and of itself is enough to warrant one star from me, even if the writing was good. This is not a healthy way to perceive men, women, gender, or sexuality.\\nI absolutely cannot recommend a piece of bad writing full of unhealthy perceptions of gender and sexuality to anyone. My hope is that the author is still quite young and with time will grow to more mature opinions, as well as more mature writing.\\nCheck out my full review: http://wp.me/pp7vL-xC (Link live on August 3, 2011) ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I was eager to read this book after reading the delightful Jack Sheppard by William Harrison Ainsworth, in which Jonathan Wild, a historical figure, is featured as the villain of the tale, both because I looked forward to learning more about Wild and because this is an example of a very early novel. Alas, although I enjoyed reading it, I was also disappointed for several reasons. \\nThe novel is a satire, in which Wild is considered \"great\" because he focuses single-mindedly on his own advancement and benefits, without indulging in the \"good\" \"weaknesses\" of compassion, honesty, fairness, or consideration of others. Indeed, Wild, along with his mentors and protegees is a sterling example of a \"great\" man as he regularly steals, incites others to steal, lies, and deceives all around him. One theory is that Fielding was actually satirizing several people high in the British government at the time.\\nFielding more or less keeps the plot moving along, with many asides to the reader (an early novel version of metafiction?), although there is a digression or two. My problem is that based on what I learned about Wild from Jack Sheppard and, in fact, on what is historically known about him, this novel takes Wild on a different path, in that he is a thief, but not the notorious \"thief-taker\" of London, who captured thieves and others and turned them in to the authorities. (Fielding apparently knew he was taking only one aspect of Wild for his satire, and the Oxford World Classic edition I read includes a contemporary biographical sketch of Wild.) Wild is a much more enjoyable villain in Jack Sheppard.\\nMy other problem with the book was that while the satire is witty and fun, it wears thin after a while. It also took me a while to get used to 18th century spelling conventions, in which nouns seem to be capitalized, although I realized that after a while I stopped noticing this. I did find it interesting to read so early a novel, when the approach and style we are used to from, say, 19th century novelists were not in place. I also appreciated the extensive notes which helped explain classical and other references.',\n",

I had no idea who Avis DeVoto was until I read this book of letters between these two. I have not yet seen the movie in which she evidently becomes known to Americans, but she is introduced quite well in this collection of letters. Covering a span of over 30 years, Avis and Julia kept up a witty, no-holds-barred trans-Atlantic correspondence covering everything from how to poach fish, how to write, edit and publish a cookbook, the chilling impact of McCarthyism on American life, finding housing in France, Norway, Germany, to whether or not to use a pressure cooker for long simmering soups and stews. \\nStarting as pen-pals and continuing for several years before they had a chance to meet, the letter-writing cemented a friendship that coincidentally involved an unofficial business relationship, and reveals two well-educated, very talented women living out their lives in roles new to both of them. Their letters were at times about subjects many would consider banal, but they offer a glimpse into a world all but forgotten in today\\'s high-tech environment.&nbsp; It is a book that is big, bold, heavy and not easily read in one sitting.&nbsp; Therein lies the beauty of it -- it can be read and savored, like a good wine, in small sips over a lingering period of time. For fans of Julia Child, it is a must read.\\nJoan Reardon has done a yeoman job of editing and compiling the correspondence to make it interesting, engaging, and compelling. ',\n",

Well I saw it on my library shelf just glaring me in the face and daring to be read, so I picked it up like a dummy; and now I want to go to the store and stock up on food, medicine and water in case the world comes to an end sometime soon. Ugh! This book is so scary and surreal, and I really regret reading it. To think this could happen is a real downer. \\nIn this novel, the moon is hit by an asteroid causing it to shift from its axis and position itself closer to the earth. This causes disastrous effects such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc; and all because the gravitational pull from the moon to the earth has been altered. The story is told from Alexs perspective and through his eyes we read about the suffering people endure because of the cold, hunger and grief that result from this event. Nothing uplifting or fulfilling about this book. Just one big disappointment and loss after another. \\nOverall, I couldnt enjoy this book. It was depressing and the religious themes wrapped around the storyline really irked me. In addition, there were aspects that l felt were left unresolved including the fate of three repeating characters. And in the end, I felt like the book just abruptly ended. Maybe that was the purpose of this novel; to challenge my religious beliefs and faith and leave me with a sense of foreboding. Grrr!

One story in the book about his wife visiting a friend in the hospital, in particular, caught my attention.

       "  'comment': 'The current method of human agriculture is in bad shape, and is ultimately unsustainable. This book provides an alternative.\\nAgriculture as we know it has worked for many thousands of years, but the system is breaking down. If there is such a thing as The Chronicle of Farm Life in the 20th Century, it is \"The Grapes of Wrath\" by John Steinbeck. Three things that had a huge impact on agriculture were the internal combustion engine, and the discoveries of oil and dynamite. When irrigating fields, runoff is created that is full of chenicals and fertilizers applied to those fields. During floods, runoff gets even worse, because that chemical-filled water gets into the rivers, which empty into the ocean, creating aquatic \"dead zones.\" In less developed countries, there is little or no attempt to filter or treat the water, and since fecal matter (human and animal) is frequently used as fertilizer, that just spreads lots of intestinal parasites. In many places, a 55-gallon drum of clean water is now more valuable than oil.\\nGreenhouse gases are turning the world\\'s oceans more acidic; the time will come when calcium carbonate, a central component of coral and mollusk shells, cannot form. Various bugs and plant diseases can also do immense damage to a wide area of crops. As agriculture becomes more commercialized, and farm sizes grow, food safety becomes a huge concern. Corporations want to cut costs wherever they can (like food inspection), and consumers have made it clear that food safety is at the top of the list.\\nImagine stacking several high-tech greenhouses on top of each other. Hydroponic gardening, which uses one-third the water of regular agriculture, is well known. Aeroponic gardening, where the roots are misted at the right times, uses one-third the water of hydroponics. The water can be treated and recycled so that it can be used over and over. No artificial chemicals would be needed. Such a vertical farm can be built in the city, vastly increasing the availability of fruits and vegetable for inner-city residents. The outer walls would be a type of clear, hard plastic, which is lighter than glass, to let in every available bit of sunlight. The corresponding amount of farmland would be allowed to turn back into whatever it was, usually hardwood forest, before it became farmland.\\nOf course, theory is easy, while turning the theory into reality is much harder. This a fascinating book, even though it is light on the reality of what a vertical farm would look like. If it does nothing more than get people thinking about other methods of agriculture, this is a gem of a book. ',\n",

       "  'comment': '*** SPOILER ALERT ***\\nUntil recently - namely until the earthquake that hit Haiti and brought the Hispaniola Island back in the limelight - whenever I heard of the Dominican Republic, my mind went to Felix Sanchez, nicknamed \"The Dictator\", a likeable US-born man with Dominican origins, a 400m Hurdles Champion and the first athlete to win an Olympic Gold Medal for that country. Alas, from now on, this country will be forever in my mind connected with its true dictator, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina, whose authoritarian, autarchic and repulsive regime has lasted 31 years. Mario Vargas Llosa has put his last days into paper, telling the personal stories of the people around him - his collaborators as well as his assasins - in the process.\\nAmongst them we find Joaquin Balaguer, his puppet president, who during the days after the Chief\\'s assasination gambled his whole life and won, survived the chaos by balancing the situation between Trujillo\\'s brothers and the USA pressure, became an elected president of his country and died at the ripe old age of 96. We find the commander of the intelligence service, the dreadful Abbes Garcia, whose practises can make prominent Nazis seem like angels, and his totally deserved, tragic end. We read about Antonio Imbert Barrera, the driver of the main car that carried Trujillo\\'s killers and only survivor - along with Luis Amiama Tio - of the group that put the plot into action, who after being hidden for 6 months by a couple of officers of the Italian Embassy and gaining 5 kilos eating pasta, found himself suddenly elected to hero status, his name being given to streets and plazas, together with those who suffered electrocution tortures, pissing and shitting themselves, naked for months in the prisons; together with a man that was brought meat to eat in prison after many months and died of a heart attack when a prison officer holding the decapitated head of the prisoner\\'s son informed him that he had just shallowed the last piece of the missing headless body.\\nThere is also a woman that returns to her country three decades later, the daughter of a prominent Trujillista. Her father had been stripped off of his powers, his bank accounts were frozen just months before the dictator was killed. Back then, still a 14-year old girl, she was offered as a present to the Chief - who liked to break a virgin\\'s cherry once in a while - as a last attempt to regain his position in the regime. Trujillo, suffering from an enlarged prostate, couldn\\'t have an erection and chose to \"punish\" the girl with his right hand. The girl hasn\\'t left a man touch her ever since, her father lost his last chances and now is a breathing corpse. A couple of weeks later, Rafael Trujillo wants to erase that shameful night from his memories. He waits impatiently in his Chevrolet to reach the same place - a new girl waiting - and has decided that this time he must make her scream with pleasure. A car waits for him in the way. Tony Imbert is the driver! ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Ive been meaning to read this book for years. Dont know why I didnt, other than there were always other books I was reading. But I went south for spring break and decided I was going to read it sometime soon. It helps that Ive been playing Final Fantasy VII for the past month or so on the weekends because I was able to get into the book really quickly. Ive only played half of the Final Fantasy games so far in my life time but it didnt really hurt my reading this. Ive played the big ones which is what most of the book focused on. I loved how the authors combined philosophy with these games as I like both topics. There were things in here that I had never thought of before, or even noticed in some cases. It makes me want to go back and replay some of these games. Ha. Maybe in a few years once Im out of school. But it did bring it all back for me and added to my understanding of what really happened in these games. It was fun and quick. I cant say for sure how much of it is or isnt accurate but it seemed solid to me. And while sometimes it seemed that some of the authors where grasping for straws on what to write about next I thought overall the book was great and entertaining. It was a good book to read at night in the hotels. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"The latest (as at May 04) in Robert Goddard's reliable annual output of excellently plotted mysteries. \\nPlay to the End is a story about an ageing actor doing a winter week's run of a Joe Orton play (newly discovered - nice touch) in Brighton. During his stay he becomes embroiled in a local intrigue that ends in serious blood-letting.\\nNormally Goddard's stories are generously spread out in time and place, but here he departs from habit. Perhaps from an urge to observe the old theatrical unities (more or less), Goddard presents all the action in the period of a single week, and all in Brighton.\\nWhile this device is enjoyable, it also tends to undermine a normally strong feature of Goddard's plots: the maintenance (if only just) of plausibility. In this book the pace of the plot seems to promise violence or death between every meal.\\nBut still a great read. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"While the new owners of the baseball team may have hailed from Wall Street, their strategies have more to do with solid business management than the financial techniques of their original stomping grounds. And the business management techniques are obviously brilliant when compared to the strawman portrayal of the previous ownership's ineptitude. And as the Rays' management's tactics aren't compared to the approach of other successful clubs, we dont' really know how unique they are. (But we certainly know what doesn't work!)\\nRegardless, the story of the Rays' rise is an enjoyable narrative, with Jonah Keri's writing conveying the story clearly. With his background as a financial/business writer, his is less fluid when telling the story of the Rays' first playoff season (the only section of the book that seemed to drag.) However, his writing on the financial tools available to large-market teams was very illuminating and highlights the revenue problems that will continue to cast a shadow on competitiveness in Major League baseball. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Writing from the perspective of the Han Dynasty, Sima Qian (145-89 BC) was in a position to assess the mistakes of the short-lived Qin that preceded the Han. Qian was actually close enough in time to the chaotic close of the Qin to be able to interview some of the participants. This volume is one of several in which Burton Watson translated portions of the Records of the Grand Historian. I haven't read any of the other volumes (for example, on the early Han), but I was impressed enough with this volume to seek out others. Qian's work reminds me somewhat of Thucydides's history of the Peloponnesian war. Qian obviously took very seriously the job of reporting what actually occured, but he also included biographical details, letters, supposed conversations that jput the modern reader in a good position to understand the historical characters and events. The scale and brutality of the Warring States period may be unprecedented. Qian reports on battles involving millions, in which I recall him describing one army as losing 240,000 killed. Also fascinating is the role of the sage philosophers in politics and governments of the day. It was not at all uncommon for wise men to travel to other states, or even enemy states, to offer their services to the ruler. Qian describes the rise of the Qin from its semi-barbaric western origins to its uniting of all of civilized China under the first Emperor. Along with success came the beginning of the excesses (building the Great Wall, ridiculous palaces, roads through mountains) that led to the downfall of the Qin under the usurper Second Emperor (and his controller, the eunuch Zhao Gao). The Qin came a long way to let it all unravel so quickly. The importance of reasonable laws and reasonable enforcement of those laws must surely have been a lesson learned by succeeding dynasties. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'You may also read my review here: http://www.mybookishways.com/2012/09/bedbugs-by-ben-h-winters.html\\nAlex, Susan, and little Emma Wendt just moved into a new apartment, the second floor of a wonderful Brooklyn brownstone, 1,300 sq. ft, a little under $3, 500/month. Sounds like a steal, right? Maybe too good to be true? Its perfect for their little family of three, and even if Andrea, their new landlord, seems a bit strange, its nothing they cant handle. Alexs photography firm, specializing in jewelry, is up and coming, and its been successful enough that Susan has quit her job to stay home and take up painting again. Its idyllic at first, until strange things start happening, and Susan eventually becomes convinced the apartment is infested with bedbugs. Everyone else, including professionals, says otherwise, but Susan has seen the bugs, and felt the bites. Unfortunately, shes the only one. Is Susan going crazy, or is something more sinister at work?\\nIf youre someone that gets squirmy reading about teeny little bugs, brace yourself. Bedbugs is a rather short book, but the author manages to pack some serious dread into those pages. Honestly, at first, I didnt like Susan all that much. Not working, at home with a 3 year old, and she hires a nanny to take Emma off her hands while she proceeds to getnot much done, accept for a few errands and unpacking the house. Ostensibly shes supposed to be painting, and eventually she does. In fact, she goes on quite a little painting spree that ends up having sinister results. Then theres her odd landlord, who seems to have quite a few secrets of her own, a friendly but somehow imposing handyman sort of seems to lurk in the background, and it doesnt help that Alex is becoming more sullen every day. I was absolutely convinced that Susan was going batty, but its not so simple, and thats the fun of this chiller. Slow dread builds into out and out terror, and its a heckuva ride. Youll probably devour this one in one sitting, if you can keep your skin from crawling long enough. Get out your bug spray and give this one a try. Theres a lot to love for thriller and horror fans alike! ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"My experience with this book was pretty rocky at first. I did not like April in the first 50 pages, but with a little help from my friend Mary from Bookfan-Mary (she loved it, btw), I decided it would be best to give April a break. My feelings of dislike did turn into something resembling compassion, and I was able to continue on. Even though I did not agree with all of Oliver's actions, I was able to connect with him more, and for the most part, I liked him.\\nThe plot itself or maybe more like - where the two would encounter one another, seemed a bit contrived, but once in the moment, the emotions felt like anything but contrived. The tension and confusion were palpable, and the suspense of what the ending may entail was always there.\\nOverall, it's a read filled with gloomy anxiety that went hand-in-hand with the characters. It turned out to be a good one, though, and I'm glad I stuck with it.\\nOriginally posted on: Thoughts of Joy \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I got this book hoping that it would provide me with scientific evidence that would help me develop a more informed opinion on the controversial issue of brainwashing. Unfortunately, Taylor points out that it is ethically impossible to conduct controlled brainwashing studies, so I did not find the specific evidence I was looking for. What the book does provide, however, is a detailed discussion of what science can tell us about how we come to believe what we do, and how influence attempts can impact that process. \\nTaylors discussion of influence techniques is thorough, ranging from advertising and education through systematic techniques used by cult leaders to the physical abuse used on American prisoners during the Korean War. By diving into neuroscience to detail how concepts and ideas are established in the brain, Taylor offers insight into how different kinds of manipulation attempts try to change how people think about the world around them. Her discussion of how skilled manipulators work to link strong emotion to a new idea in attempt to bypass the critical thought processes that would make people stop and think is particularly important for people interested in cultic issues. \\n ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Title: The Heros Lot\\nAuthor: Patrick W. Carr\\nPages: 448\\nYear: 2013\\nPublisher: Bethany House\\n\\tA few months ago, I read and reviewed Patrick W. Carrs debut novel, A Cast of Stones, and I wrote, [I]f the sequels are as good as the first book, then Carr is on his way to an outstanding writing career. Well, I just finished reading an advanced reading copy of Carrs second book in the series, and I can honestly say that I have not changed my mind. \\n\\tThe Heros Lot picks up where A Cast of Stones ends. Errol Stone, now a trained fighter and a member of the nobility, is compelled to go on a quest to find and kill a dangerous enemy to the kingdomSarin Valona traitor possessed by evil. The problem of fulfilling his mission is that the traitor is deep within a neighboring land that plans to invade the kingdom upon the impending death of the king. Earl Stone must face many dangers along his journey, but he is not alone as his companions vow to protect and aid him on his quest. To complicate matters, Errols true lovePrincess Adorahas followed him after running away from the arrogant lord that her uncle, the king, promised her to in marriage.\\n\\tErrol and his some of his companions find themselves followed by domestic enemies as well as thwarted by Valons agents throughout the journey. Errol must learn who he can trust and who his friends are, some of whom he finds in unlikely places. He learns that he plays an essential role in the kingdoms survival, but he realizes that either he or the young man that seems destined to be the next king will die. He assumes that it is he who must die and resigns himself to that fate, but renewed hope and the will to live, for the woman he loves, gives him the strength needed to survive and escape captivity and death at the hands of the enemies that fear him.\\n\\tErrol fulfills his mission and escapes, but on the way home, he and his friends realize that the king is dead. The story ends leaving readers wondering what is next in store for Errol and the kingdom as war is about to commence. Can he live up to his destiny? Will the rightful successor be placed on the throne? Or will enemies from within and from outside the kingdom prevail?\\n\\tPatrick W. Carrs second novel is even more exciting than the first as Errols story continues to unfold. The characters are interesting and believable as more of who they are is revealed. They are flawed, but they grow into better people as they make the nearly impossible journey. The settings are reminiscent of the real world of historical cultural although Carrs novel takes place in kingdoms and lands of his creation. Carr uses his characters and the world that he has created to allegorically explore the world we live in from historical and spiritual aspects as well as similarities in what is happening in the current timeline. The human condition is shown from introspective viewpoints along with the realization that individuals all have a part to play in the important events that affect thousands, even millions, of lives. I look forward to the third novel in the series. \\n\\tMy rating is 5 stars. \\nNote: I received a complimentary copy for an honest review of this book.

       "  'comment': 'Marry in haste, repent in leisure is an old proverb that could well have been in Georgette Heyers mind as she thought up the plot to Fridays Child. An angry rejected suitor swears to marry the first woman he sets his eyes upon, but perhaps fate has stepped in and given him his perfect match, if only he could see it. Young poor-relation Hero, accepts his proposal as she has always had a crush on Lord Anthony and sees this as a perfect way to avoid being shipped off as a governess. Although her family comes to see the benefits of this alliance, and their friends rally around, Lord Anthonys mother does not seem in any hurry to come around and, in fact, seems to be enjoying slandering her new daughter-in-law to all who will listen.\\nHero, having been raised simply in the country does not know all the fine details of manoeuvring through polite society. With no one to guide her, she makes plenty of missteps along the way. Lord Anthony, instead of helping her, often either laughs at her follies or scolds her. Eventually she makes a mistake that he cant excuse and she decides the best solution is to run away.\\nHow these two young people overcome all obstacles, including their own rather silly and at times, selfish natures made for a very clever and intriguing story. These two had a lot of growing up to do, as they both tend to be impulsive and between them possess only about half a brain. They are however charming and very likeable and you cant help but root for them.\\nAs always with Georgette Heyer, her eye to detail is spot on whether she is describing the fashionable clothes, furnishings or food of the day. I truly think her best work is in the dialogue, she uses the popular phrasing from that time and some very clever and amusing tidbits are sprinkled throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed this light comedy of errors. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I regard the term \"Christian self-help\" as an oxymoron, and generally try and stay clear of anything that has the slightest whiff of \"I can do all things\" divorced from the essential \"through God who strengthens me\". This book surprised me in many ways - and challenged me at the same time.\\nArterburn does not flinch from asking the reader to take responsibility for their own actions. He points out the symptoms of unforgiveness, contrasting them with his six qualities of a happy, healthy relationship, always pointing to God as the healer and not our efforts or therapeutic strategies. He also confronts the reader with the need for making restitution for the wrongs one has done - not simply thinking that being forgiven absolves one from their responsibility to make right the wrong that was done.\\nThe chatty, informal approach helps but also hinders - this reader would like to have been given tough questions for journal work or group discussion that would help me to face and acknowledge areas in my life where I am in denial, holding secrets or resentments, and protesting my innocence too much, instead of facing the ugly truth and being cleansed and healed from it. Without such questions there is the danger of this book being used in a group study where the questions asked of each participant probe no deeper than the turf covering the underlying septic tank.

       "  'comment': \"Laumer starts out with a real Sturgeon formula as outlined in books like More Than Human and in some measure The Dreaming Jewels- the special person or persons have to go through the trials and tribulations arranged all too willingly by a cast of gritty manevolent characters in order to reach their final moment of self realization. He uncharacteristically does not use a first person narrative to tell the tale of his downtrodden bum idiot Adam, who speaks in the tongues of many people, and is bounced from one cruel turn to another. Finally he settles down with a con artist bent on using his telepathic gift, to become rich and in the process Adam begins to learn who and what he really is.The story covers his growing from one level of conciousness to the next. But this book is not merely a superman book, this is an epistemological allegory. The Infinite Cage of the title is conciousness itself, the true shape of our limitation, the trap we twist and turn in all our lives to escape though we don't realize it. This is a novel of great insight, sorrow and humor. Laumer is a psychologist of surprising acuity. This story is certainly on level with the kind of thing Sturgeon writes and it might even surpass. Last year I had been startled at how well done Dinosaur Beach was; I thought I knew what this guy was about and that story was far better than I anticpated. This one knocks it out of the park. I certainly didn't expect a book of this depth. I would not be surprised if this turned out be his best book when I'm finished with reading everything he's done. It'll be hard to top. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I didn\\'t expect this book to be so bad before I started reading it as I had higher hopes for it. But, I was wrong. Dualed has a strong and intriguing premise which drew me to it beforehand. It truly has great potential, but it doesn\\'t fulfill it in its execution.\\nWe have here a dystopian former United States and this story takes place in the north-western part of it, probably around the formerly known areas of Washington State or Oregon. The area of Kersh, which main character West lives in, is run by a government that never receives much literary development, but it has a policy of creating duplicates of every citizen born and forcing them to fight each other to the death during their adolescent years. Why, you ask? Good question. Why, indeed....\\nThis sounds like it\\'s moving into improbable territory and it is. The government seems to want only the strongest to survive, thus each citizen and their Alternate must duke it out until one of them dies and they only have one month to do it, or they both self-destruct. Sure..... That\\'s sounds about as plausible as me winning the lottery even though I\\'ve never bought a lottery ticket in my life. *heh*\\nNot to mention all the inherent contradictions within the shaky world building and within the character of West herself. I don\\'t think this story was well thought-out before being written and published. West Grayer is one of the most horrible, unlikable heroines I\\'ve ever encountered. She endangers the lives of those she cares about the most because she is stupid and careless and then blames others for her mistakes.\\nAfter getting someone very close to her killed in the beginning of the story, because she is a freaking twit, she decides to get a job as a \"striker,\" an assassin who takes out Alternates for hire. She\\'s never done work like this in her life and she\\'s a skinny 15-year-old girl. She has a bit of training from her older brothers because they all had to grow up knowing they\\'d need to kill their Alts one day. But, it\\'s not like she\\'s experienced. Still, she gets the job as a striker without any trial period, or training, as if she were a total veteran. Not realistic. At all.\\nAnd, why is she even doing this type of work all of a sudden? Because it distracts her from feeling so bad about the deaths of all her family members. Honestly, I don\\'t buy that because she just seems unemotional and unfeeling about their deaths and everything else, for that matter. Her guy friend, Chord (what is with these names?) is an old friend, but she constantly pushes him away the entire story until she decides she\\'s in love with him. Out of nowhere. I\\'m glad there wasn\\'t much romance because it would have made me puke.\\nThe action scenes are written brilliantly and there\\'s plenty of them. This is where it shines and along with the idea of the story, it is strong, but that\\'s where it ends. A great idea is nothing in the hands of one who can do nothing meaningful with it.\\nThe details of the dystopian world feel like our regular everyday world. There is too much freedom for this girl who supposedly lives in a controlled state. She shouldn\\'t even be able to move so freely and even become a striker. She shouldn\\'t be able to bleach her hair to change her appearance, but she does. Where are the government officials to bully and spy on her like they ought to be? When it comes down to it, the world building is actually very generic and uncreative, too much like our free world.\\nI give this novel 2.5/5 stars for having good technical writing and great action scenes. But, the horrible main character and the boring supporting cast along with the poorly thought-out world building kept me from being able to really enjoy it.\\n*I was provided an eARC of this novel by the publisher in exchange for my honest opinion of it.

       "  'comment': 'The hype surrounding the movie release has, inevitably, included a number of \"The Next Harry Potter!!\" claims. So, my opinion right up front: I\\'m not a Harry Potter fan-boy (especially of the later books) but this does not measure up to Rowlings\\' work.\\nThe Lightning Thief has an interesting plot concept. The Greek Gods are still around and, occasionally, have children with mortals whom they largely ignore thereafter. Inevitably, the Olympians being the fractious group that they are, some of those children get sucked into a dangerous power struggle between the immortals.\\nUnfortunately, that\\'s about it for the good points. The rest isn\\'t bad, so much, as only fair. The most descriptive word I can think of for the writing is clumsy. The dialog is stilted, all characters other than the main ones are cardboard, and the plot lurches along at an uneven pace, taking little detours to add other characters from Greek mythology into the story line for no apparent purpose. \\nThings with which the author hoped to surprise the reader fail to surpriseI figured out the traitor by about page 50 though the characters need until about page 350. There\\'s even the cardinal sin that things obvious to my 12 year old weren\\'t obvious to the adults in the book who had the same facts: \"Let\\'s see, you\\'re the son of a god, you love the ocean more than anything, you can make water fly through the air, all tiredness falls away when you\\'re in water...hmmm, whose your daddy? Nope, nope...nothing\\'s ringing a bell here.\" \\nPerhaps the thing that bothered me the most was the awkward attempt at humor. I\\'m not referring to characters cracking a joke; those were fine. It was the off-the-wall elements that appeared at random intervals in an otherwise serious story that made me think Riordan was spontaneously channeling Terry Pratchett...very badly. I mean, come on, an EZ Pass lane to get into Hades?...that\\'s out of place in a book with this tone.\\nYoung readers may like this book and, given that they are the target audience, I don\\'t say it\\'s a bad story. However, I don\\'t recommend it for older readers. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'This is one of my favorite Silver Age DC story ever. Cooke is obviously a huge fan of this period, and it comes through in his writing. He also does such a fantastic job of incorporating real-world history into his version of the DC Universe. Seeing the impact on McCarthyism and the fear created during the Red Scare on the world and life of the Superhero is powerful, especially seeing what became of the Justice Society of America members. The other beautiful thing about New Frontier is the way Darwyn looks at the lives of these heroes outside of their adventures. We see Hal Jordan at his lowest before he gained the mantle of the Green Lantern, we see Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant fighting one of his final bouts in the ring against Cassius Clay (Muhammed Ali), we see the Challengers of the Unknown before they were a group (and the connections between Ace Morgan, Hal Jordan, Rick Flagg, and King Faraday was absolute genius). This is such a fantastic read. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Being a big fan of the Southern Vampire Mysteries I picked up another of Charlaine Harris' novels thinking to get the same attachment. Needless to say I was disappointed.\\n While the main characters were okay and the plot had the potential to be great, the ending was kind of a dud. After the build up throughout the novel, the ending was abruptly summed up in the last 3 pages. Simple 'goodbyes' were said between characters that should have been more emotional. Not to mention little mistakes like Nell went from being 16 years old, to 17, then back to 16 and at times the dialog was confusing as to who was saying what. More action would have been nice, it seemed that what little action the story had was resolved in less than a page.\\nOverall I gave it three stars because I love the stories centered around a Brother/Sister setting and the story had a nice flow. Harper and Tolliver were well written but it seems this novel was toned down when compared to the Sookie novels, which was disappointing knowing Harris has the skills to write a great novel. \\nWould not exactly recommend this book to others but I will continue to read the series. \",\n",

Now, with all the talk surrounding the television series, I decided it was high time I find my way back to Westeros. \\nI was happy this time 'round I had a Kindle... it is a long book! But as I was reading, I didn't notice the length so much, mostly because there are so many different stories within this one book.\\nThe majority of the story focuses on the Stark clan of the far north. They are stoic and stubborn, and have the moral high ground in a politically shaky world. When the patriarch, Ned, heads south at the behest of his friend, King Robert Baratheon, he finds himself deep in the sinister machinations of the Lannisters. The Lannisters aspire for control, and it rarely matters how they come by what they desire. Meanwhile, across the sea there is young Daenerys, last scion to the fallen Targaryen clan, once ruler of the kingdoms. All the story lines blend together, slowly revealing the overall picture. \\nThe characters are interesting, even the minor characters are fairly well-developed and easy to keep track of. The plot can only be described as immersive- the world is so completely created and vividly imagined. The intrigues, twists, and adventures all live up to expectations. \\nMartin pulls no punches, nothing is safe, and nothing is what it seems. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Five have united at last! Through the previous novels of the Gatekeepers series, different members of The Five were discovering their powers. Matt Freeman is the leader of The Five and has the strongest strength, Jamie and Scott are the twin brothers of The Five and have the ability to control minds, Pedro is the member who has the ability to heal and is thought to be a descendent of a Incan god, and finally, Scarlet is the member with the ability to control the weather. Together these five individuals make up the only force that can destroy and finally contain The Old Ones, an ancient evil with the goal of consuming the entire world with darkness and to wipe out all of man kind. In the novel, Scarlet is found by the rest of The Five while in Hong Kong. She was being held captive by Nightrise, an evil corporation working along side The Old Ones. Scar was originally in Hong Kong to visit her dad at his job at Nightrise, but the whole visit was just a trap to isolate her and keep her from being found by the other four members. Scar was kept hostage in her fathers home by two creatures working for The Old Ones but was able to escape them after a group, formally known as the Triad, killed the creatures and transported her to a safe house. The Triad was then able to bring her to Matt and the others by boat to an island remotely located in the bay of the Triad leaders estate. To escape from Hong Kong, The Five must fine one of the 12 doors that can lead them around the world. They find the door inside an ancient temple but are attacked by Nightrise. The Five make it through the door but unfortunately they have become separated again and have begun the cycle all over again, they must unite once again. \\n\\tThe protagonists of the novel are The Five and the antagonists are The Old Ones and Nightrise. The jacket of the novel was a very intriguing aspect of this book. It drew me in because of the color combinations, the ancient symbols depicted on the front, and the symbol for The Five was in the center of the cover. The cover also helped explain parts of the descriptions made in the book.\\n\\tI would recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting, slightly horrifying, and historically inspired book. The events of the book are historically correct, well stated and very descriptive. The book is a thrill to read and one of the greatest books Anthony Horowitz has ever written. ',\n",

Ginsberg convincingly portrays Marinas transformation from fake psychic to real one; in my opinion, this is the most interesting part of the book. Unfortunately, the secondary characters are too two-dimensional for my taste. For one thing, I had trouble believing so many of Marinas clients would be nearly murderous with rage; it felt like a device used to confuse the reader rather than an organic part of the plot. I disliked the shifting points of view for the same reasonnone of the other characters were developed enough to justify focusing on each of them in turn. Finally, the final confrontation was too outrageous to be believable. Ironically, it isnt Marinas newfound psychic ability that stretched my disbelief, but rather the rest of the story. In the end, I liked the idea of this book much better than its execution.\\nA slightly different version of this review can be found on my blog, she reads and reads. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'This is a long, dense read which rewards all effort. It re-establishes Cosimo and his contemporaries in the context of their own times, showing the daily reality of Christian life with particular reference to popular culture. Too often viewed as rich, powerful, self-serving merchants, Cosimo and other patrons are shown to be men very concerned with spiritual life, who kept commonplace books filled with quotations from Christian authors, who sought advice from wise and holy men. Kents portrait of the city and its people is fresh and surprising. Although Cosimo eludes us as a character  he knew how to be private  he emerges from this study as worthy of the title Pater Patriae. Throughout the work, Kent quietly and deftly puts previous biographers and historians in their place, showing what a mistake it is to view the past through the lens of our own ideologies. The common view of Cosimo as a cynical manipulator of government to his own ends, and hiding it with a cloak of religious imagery, is shown to be the product of the Risorgimento and Marxism. To dismiss his patronage of religious buildings and art as buying a ticket to heaven is a mistake. He sincerely felt the need to give his wealth back to God and the cynical view that this is hogwash reflects more on the dismissers than the dismissed. Kents approach is rational and wise. She neither romanticises nor exaggerates. She just allows the man to emerge from a painstaking depiction of his background. A first-rate contribution to studies of the period which, it is to be hoped, puts the record straight once and for all. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'This summer, a new edition of the book came up for review on LibraryThings Early Reviewers program. While too late to be of use to me, I was still interested in reading it. Most everything I learned about A.L.S. I learned by word of mouth from the A.L.S.A. folks or other patients and their families. Would a book on A.L.S. really have the goods? Robert G. Millers Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis was quite good, but it didnt have the depth to really prepare me for the day to day miserableness that A.L.S. turned out to be for our family. I didnt know that at the time I read the book, of course. But its an excellent starting point.\\nHiroshi Mitsumotos guide covers A.L.S. with about as much depth as is possible in a book of this size. Its breadth is amazing as well. The sheer amount of information in this book staggers me. If you or a family member has A.L.S., you want this book available.\\nThe example I will pick is communication. Since mom had bulbar-onset A.L.S. which was very fast progressing, she lost her ability to speak early. She had the use of a Dynavox A.A.C. (augmentative alternative communication) device. Even with A.A.C. to speak for her, we had numerous communication problems. And unfortunately, none of the speech language pathologists in her county had any experience with A.L.S. The guide covers several stages of managing communications: early stage when speech is still possible, middle stage when speech isnt really possible, and late stage when a patient is nearly completely paralyzed. It covers habits patients and family members can change. It covers both low and high technology options. Toward the end, mom controlled her A.A.C. using her feet after she lost the use of her hands. Luckily, she died before she lost the use of her feet for communication. I was dreading what we would do when she was paralyzed completely. This book details some options.\\n(As a side note, while it was not good that mom had A.L.S. and I would have liked more time with her had she been healthier, she suffered during her final couple of months. That death came when it did prevented further suffering for her. My use of \"luckily\" in the previous paragraph in a positive sense about her timely death is considered and thorough.)\\nOr another example: this guide has a full chapter on integrated care in A.L.S. clinics. A.L.S. affects large swaths of a persons life and numerous health issues have to be treated. In an A.L.S. clinic, each of the specialists visits the patient in turn. The alternative primary care doctor treatment and referral system that is prevalent in the U.S. is exceedingly cumbersome for treating A.L.S. General practitioner, neurologist, speech language pathologist, respiratory specialist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, orthopedic specialist, and more. Whatcom County Washington has no A.L.S. clinic, so I had to constantly schedule all of these appointments and transport mom (never an easy task) to each. An A.L.S. clinic greatly reduces the number of visits. In addition, all the medical professionals involved in a persons care can confer over their treatment. But there are drawbacks, as the author of that chapter notes. The visits can be extremely long and tiring, and travel to these clinics is not easy if one isnt located nearby. Mom also found with her pair of visits to an A.L.S. clinic that if the facility does not have electronic medical records, the questions asked by each specialist duplicate 75% of the questions previously asked.\\nSome caveats about Mitsumotos book though. First off, the audience for the first edition was other doctors treating A.L.S. patients. Theyve changed the focus for the last two editions, but its roots show. The amount of medical jargon is overwhelming to the point of needing a translator at times even though Ive got a lot of familiarity with the material. Those starting out with A.L.S. may find it too much to grok.\\nSecond, also rooted in the medical establishment origins, is that the book is very clinical in tone. In other words, this is a doctor whose bedside manner is very much telling you the facts, rather than one that is geared toward helping you process and make decisions. Lots of caveats and on the other hands and infrequent \"bottom line, do this\" statements. Readers may be find the choices presented to be daunting. Granted, an A.L.S. patient should never be far from a doctors advice anyway, but I imagine it might frustrating to read something here that gives all sorts of treatment possibilities and then wait until a doctor visit can help make sense of those options.\\nNevertheless, those who have to deal with A.L.S. and like an abundance of good information will find this book indispensable.\\nReview also at my blog: http://reading.kingrat.biz/reviews/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-hiroshi-mitsumo...

       "  'comment': \"Maybe I'm a sucker for books about dads and daughters, but The Reading Promise seems to me to be a delightful memoir about a single father and the way he connected with his daughter through reading out loud. Written by the daughter (Alice Ozma), the book recounts the story of the The Streak, the 3,170 consecutive nights on which her father read aloud to her.\\nIn some ways, the book is also a coming of age story, as the daughter grows through the difficult years and becomes a young woman. Her father chooses books with themes that are appropriate to her emotional development and the books grow in difficulty and sophistication even as she does.\\nPersonal note: I'd like to thank my own daughter for giving me this book as a Christmas present. Like the Brozinas, we are a reading family. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Laura Baskes Litwin's Fannie Lou Hamer: Fighting for the Right to Vote analyzes the political life of sharecropper turned civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. Along with her launch into the voting rights arena in the summer of 1962 up until a 1976 recognition of her accomplishments by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C., the book sharply documents the key events of the civil rights era that help reaffirm that Hamer was indeed a courageous woman in the face of hatred and dissention. More of her private life needed to be investigated for the account though as we learn through scant mention that she had a long-suffering husband and a daughter that died from malnutrition. That end of things would probably have entailed a larger book not aimed at the young adult readership the slimmer book targets. This is a good companion piece to the study of modern American history at the eighth grade and high school level. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Spotlight Reviews are my way of playing catch up. I read and didn\\'t review a ton of of books from last year that I always wanted to share my thoughts on. These reviews will be short and sweet with just my basic thoughts and are my way of \"catching up\".\\nSummary from Goodreads (with possible spoilers):\\n\"Quitting her husband\\'s house and moving back in with her horrible family, Lady Maccon becomes the scandal of the London season.\\nQueen Victoria dismisses her from the Shadow Council, and the only person who can explain anything, Lord Akeldama, unexpectedly leaves town. To top it all off, Alexia is attacked by homicidal mechanical ladybugs, indicating, as only ladybugs can, the fact that all of London\\'s vampires are now very much interested in seeing Alexia quite thoroughly dead.\\nWhile Lord Maccon elects to get progressively more inebriated and Professor Lyall desperately tries to hold the Woolsey werewolf pack together, Alexia flees England for Italy in search of the mysterious Templars. Only they know enough about the preternatural to explain her increasingly inconvenient condition, but they may be worse than the vampires -- and they\\'re armed with pesto.\"\\nMy Thoughts:\\nI honestly just adore this series! Alexia is back and better than ever in Blameless. She is such a fun main character to read about. Alexia is witty, strong, and always surprising. I can never guess what she is going to say or do next which makes reading these books lots of fun. Without trying to give a lot away (considering this is the 3rd book in this series), I found the plot to be quite interesting and filled with suspense. After the second book finished, I honestly didn\\'t know what to expect from this book but I wasn\\'t disappointed. The storyline moved at a fast pace and before I knew it I was finished. Satisfied but impatient for the next book. What makes this book so good in my opinion is that the author constantly kept me turning the pages as I was invested in the characters. I love that the secondary characters in this series are just as interesting and well-developed as Alexia. It makes this series that much better in my opinion. All in all, this book is a must read for fans of steampunk and urban fantasy! But that being said you must start at the beginning with the first book to get the full flavor and experience. Trust me when I say that you will be hooked :) Highly recommended!\\nDisclosure- I was lucky enough to be sent a copy of this book from the publisher. Unfortunately, I am just now getting my review posted. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"After coming accros Getting Things Done (referred to as GTD) on the internet several times, my interest in this book was born. Not being a very disorganized person, I am always open to increase the effectiveness and organization in my own life.\\nReading Getting Things Done by David Allen really inspired me to at least start thinking about how I want to organize my personal and work related life, and if there are any big flaws in the way I organize things now. The idea of having an inbox where you drop all your thoughts, ideas and tasks sounds appealing to me, if it will help get things off your mind. As Allen describes it, it is more usefull knowing the things you are not doing now instead off not knowing what you need to do.\\nSetting up the system seems quite some hassle if you ask me. Maybe that's because it really is complicated, or Allen makes it complicated by going pretty indepth about his system. Ofcourse it is good that he is describing the system as solid as he can, but doing this without too much of a structure made me go lost somewhere halfway while getting my way through the book.\\nThough I had some problems with a lack of real structure and got annoyed by overload of vague referring Allen is good at (one colleague of mine, a friend of mine, a client of mine at this company, a client of mine at that company, whatever colleague of mine at whatever company), still I am triggered to start of organizing my life and overload of information more.\\nI am not saying I am exactly going to take over the Getting Things Done method, but will at least consider it. Though I am tempted to say my current way of organizing and collecting seems fine, I might be fooling myself. I am just going to give it a go and see how it works out, maybe it will indeed change my life like it has done for the ten thousands of clients Allen has made happy.\\nGetting Things Done is a great book for someone who is interested in lifehacks, who is willing to make the best out of it and is constantly looking for ways to give more value to his life, in this case by organizing and emptying your head into the inbox bucket. However, for someone who doesn't think about these things at all, who is not tempted or triggered to improve organizing his information and tasks (let be honest, this is the case for most people) this book is not really your thing and I suggest you just pass it in the bookstore on your way to the comics, with all due respect.\\nIf you are for all this, I also suggest you take a look around at the great tools internet has to offer in setting up this Getting Things Done method. I especially got triggered into Gettings Things Done after reading an article at http://lifehacker.com on setting GTD up within Remember the Milk, a feature rich application that enables you to set up lists of your tasks on your computer and/or PDA with the option of recording your progress. \",\n",

I will still call it that because I'd rather not acknowledge the Yankee Swap debacle. Anyway good present..Interesting to read, since I am easily impressed by serious work in math. I am easily doubtful, though, too.I like all the pieces in this book a lot. I like comics and I like nonfiction and biography and even the philosophy lessons, and I like the Oresteia and meta-discussion about what's come after this work of Bertrand Russell's. Unfortunately the more kinds of things there were the less I was sure what the book was meant to be like. So I started to miss things -- Is it bad I don't really understand Russell's Paradox? Why the Greek tragedy, exactly? Where did the story of the second half of Russell's life go?Particularly, I liked the thematic connection made to the invention of the computer, and the idea of Russell's eventual theoretic victory being proved in that field. I wish there'd been more about it here -- perhaps the creators really are working on a follow-up on that subject, as they meta-joked they could, but if not it seems a missed opportunity to bring it all home. Web programmers I know are interested in the book for these reasons too. It's definitely meaningful.Probably worth a reread one day. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Alvarez is deeply conflicted about the quinceaera. In a time where Latina teens have such distressingly high drop-out and pregnancy rates, is the \"princess in the patriarchy fantasy\" helping or hurting? Should working-class families really be going into debt to throw a fancy ball for their fifteen-year-olds? Does the quinceaera honor community and ethnicity, or is it an US-ian insta-tradition? Is it stimulating Hispanic economy, or is it playing into American consumerism? Is it an expression of hope for the girls\\' futures, or pessimism about them? Or both?\\nAnd given all her feminist-liberal doubts about the quinceaera, why, why does Alvarez get weepy over them? Is it the concrete demonstration of the community\\'s love and hope for each of these girls? Or is she, in the end, just another sucker for a sparkly pink princess dress?\\nInterwoven into her exploration of the role and history of the modern quinceaera, she tells the story of her own prolonged and halting efforts to learn how to be a Latina adult in the U.S., to invent a role herself that is neither Marianisma nor Malinche. Which, of course, leads back to the question: what does it mean, as a Latina girl, to come of age? And if you were going to have a ritual to mark that---or to guide girl on her way---what should that ritual be?\\nAs you might imagine, there are far more questions here than answers---although in her exploration of the questions, there\\'s a lot she shares about culture, community, family, and history. But even if there are more questions than answers, sometimes there\\'s as much value in figuring out what the questions can and should be, than in figuring out their answers.',\n",

       "  'comment': '4.5/5\\nIn The Least Envied, one easily recognizes the first leg of what Joseph Campbell described as The Heros Journey. The Hero\\'s Journey is a deeply satisfying narrative structure found in all sorts of drama, storytelling, myth, religious ritual, and psychological development. To begin the journey, a hero first receives a Call To Adventure, which the hero refuses, of course. Fortunately, a magical guide comes to the hero\\'s aid and helps the hero Cross the First Threshold, into dangerous realms where the hero enters The Belly of the Whale, which separates them from the known world, and where the hero will undergo a metamorphosis. \\nWe all know and love the structure because the adventures the hero faces will not only be challenging and exciting, but will illuminate some concept and enrich our understanding of the world, and ourselves. \\nThe plot structure is the only aspect of The Least Envied that was predictable. The characters, dialogue, actions, and ambiance are fresh and intriguing. Sean DeLauder begins his novel with \"So this was the fabled West, gritty and mean.\" But this is not the US Westit is the West of some strange world, with strange steel-boned creatures and giant monsters that stomp through Dirtburg, a dusty town with characters that had me hooting and cursing, all at once. \\nDeLauder writes with an unique style that I enjoyed from Speaker for the Trees. His voice is fresh and interesting, but this novel is not for fast reading, and certainly not for skimming. So much is unexpected that nearly each and every word has to be dissected and savored. The attention is worth the effort because the images are quite vivid and wonderful.\\nMany themes are explored during this hero\\'s adventurethe nature of heroism, for one, and fate, among others. There is an undercurrent of philosophy here, but without preachiness or pretension, more like Lord of the Rings in some respects, yet thoroughly modern and gritty in others. \\nNow that you find yourself primed and ready for this adventure, I must admit that I was one of Sean\\'s First Readers, lucky enough to possess the manuscript before publication. Be patient, for he\\'ll have the edited version out sometime soonand then all of us can wait for Part II together. ',\n",

The ordeal of many is told through the first person narrative of a young Japanese-American boy. (The reader never finds out the boy\\'s real name, only that his nickname is \"Shorty\".) When the boy\\'s older brother began becoming defiant towards his father, Shorty\\'s dad decided he had to build a baseball diamond to get everyone\\'s mind off the humiliation they were experiencing at the camp. Just as the book\\'s title states, baseball really did save people. Everyone got involved with the endeavor. Mothers even sewed baseball uniforms out of mattress covers. It is important for fourth grade students to know that California had two Japanese internment camps. One was in Manzanar and the other in Tule Lake. Illustrator Dom Lee rendered the drawings by applying beeswax on paper and then scratching out the images. The drawings that depict scenes at the camp are brown and dark and depressing. Not until the end of the book, when the war is over and Shorty hits a homerun, does Lee add some color. What makes this book even more poignant is that Mochizuiki\\'s own parents were sent to an inernment camp during the war. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'From Publishers Weekly\\nGrade-school irreverence abounds in this compendium of (extremely brief) fractured fairy tales, which might well be subtitled \"All Things Gross and Giddy.\" With a relentless application of the sarcasm that tickled readers of The True Story of the Three Little Pigs , Scieszka and Smith skewer a host of juvenile favorites: Little Red Running Shorts beats the wolf to grandmother\\'s house; the Really Ugly Duckling matures into a Really Ugly Duck; Cinderumpelstiltskin is \"a girl who really blew it.\" Text and art work together for maximum comic impact--varying styles and sizes of type add to the illustrations\\' chaos, as when Chicken Licken discovers that the Table of Contents, and not the sky, is falling. Smith\\'s art, in fact, expands upon his previous waggery to include increased interplay between characters, and even more of his intricate detail work. The collaborators\\' hijinks are evident in every aspect of the book, from endpapers to copyright notice. However, the zaniness and deadpan delivery that have distinguished their previous work may strike some as overdone here. This book\\'s tone is often frenzied; its rather specialized humor, delivered with the rapid-fire pacing of a string of one-liners, at times seems almost mean-spirited. Ages 5-up. \\nCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"This a book that kept me on the edge of my seat. At times there were tears pouring down my face as I read what Jaycee Duggard had to endure. At other times I just had to put it down a walk away because I felt such pain for her. I think part of it for me is that I have a daughter who just turned 12 and Jaycee was 11 when she was taken. I can picture my daughter in mind and makes it me so upset. I definitely hugged my daughter harder after reading Jaycee's story. I am always trying to balance protecting her from predators while giving her the freedom to develop into the person she is meant to be. This book has sparked conversations about being aware of your surroundings and trusting your inner instinct of danger to protect yourself. As someone who has been kidnapped it was interesting to read Jaycee personally approaches protecting her own daughters from the dangers of the world.\\nOn the day Jaycee was taken, she was a young girl who was still playing with Barbies. She had no concept of what sex was nor should she have. What she was subjected to by her kidnappers, Phillip and nancy Garrido was pure hell. She went from being a cherished daughter and turned into a object for Phillip Garrido to play out his twisted fantasies on. Nancy and Phillip are two of the sickest people on the planet and deserve every bit of the public hate and scorn that has been heaped upon Casey Anthony. Some things that will stay with me from this story is how the Garridos used animals against Jaycee. They knew that she loved animals so much so they would do twisted things like give her a pet only to remove it suddenly after she had become attached to the animal. I don't how Jaycee endured all that she did. The mental and physical torture was incredible. Giving birth at the age of 13 with no pain killers or hospital care is beyond my comprehension and she gave birth twice. Not only that but she seems to be an extraordinary mother. I had tears pouring down when I read how she was not able to say her name to the police officers when she finally had law enforcements attention. She had not spoken her name in 19 years so she had to write it on a piece of paper. Now she has taken her name and her life back and the Garridos cannot hurt her or anyone she loves any more. Her powerful victim impact statement is on Wikipedia and it showcases the courage that enabled her to endure all that she has. Many people let Jaycee Duggard down, her step father, law enforcement, and most of all the Garridos, yet she carries no hate in her heart. It's a powerful lesson that needs to be read by everyone who has endured suffering\\nIf there are any flaws in this book it is in the narrative. The actual book itself is somewhat disjointed. There are times when she talks about the past and then will jump to the present or insert a reflection. It's almost as if she is talking talking to you and will suddenly remember something else she wanted to tell you. There is also a long stretch where she includes the journal of the day to day activities of one of the cats, Eclipse. She explains that her memories are disjointed like the book and that it will probably take years for her to straighten everything out in even her own mind. Whatever problems the book has in editing are overcome by the power of her story. I read that the state of California is giving her 20 million in a settlement to make reparations for the lapse of the parole board in not doing a proper of checking up on Phillip Garrido. When she recounts some of the things that man has said you wonder why he was not locked up for life long before he ever met Jaycee Duggard. Even though the money is no compensation for what she endured I hope it enables to live a long and happy life with her daughters. I am sure her story will continue to inspire other victims of tragedies as well as the countless other parents of missing children who will never give up searching for their own ending. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Welcome back to the world of Ash, of Carthage under the penitence, and all the rest - albeit to a time before Ash.\\nIt would be tempting to say this is a story about someone wanting to learn the \"new art\" and his or her adventures. New Art in this sense is what we\\'d call perspective drawing as opposed to the earlier Medieval drawing style, where people are drawn in a fashion that is very odd to the modern eye. This would, to some extent be true.\\nBut it is far, far more than that. Ilario is a hermaphrodite, and it contains quite a lot about the roles of men and women in society, from someone who is both and neither. It deals with slavery and life as a slave. It deals with love in a number of forms. It deals with growing up. \\nIt also deals with bigger political issues in the context of the time - betrayal, espionage, Greek (well Carthaginian) gifts - not quite a trojan horse mind, international diplomacy and more.\\nIt also, like Ash, deals with someone out of place - a hermaphrodite in this case rather than a woman mercenary captain, but also a lot of eunuchs and the like, dealing in that way with some very similar themes to Ash.\\nRather than telling you what happens, get out there and read it. It\\'s great, and although it\\'s over 600 pages of quite dense reading (I\\'m surprised it\\'s this short, it feels more like 900 pages), it\\'s well worth it. ',\n",

Lisbeth has been traveling, but suddenly a dangerous thug seems to be trailing her. Through a strange course of events, Lisbeth is wanted by the police for murder. \\nI enjoyed this second installment in the trilogy significantly more than the first one.

       "  'comment': \"The level of enthusiasm for Women in Black turned out to be understandable when we discovered how much personal knowledge of 1950s Sydney, and in particular David Jones, there was amongst our group. Most found this book a nostalgic trip into a past world where things seemed less complicated and there was much more goodwill around. The whole group felt St John captured the era perfectly and her focus on the characters rather than the plot helped to make it the enjoyable read it was.\\nThere were plenty of laughs around the table as memories of fashion shopping and joining the work force were discussed and although we agreed the past is more often than not looked back on through rose-coloured glasses, it was still fun to relive this innocent time through the security of, dare I say it, mature wisdom!\\nAll this praise is not to say there were no negatives. Joan felt the whole story was some what superficial and that the writing style lacked creativity. There were also a few who did not really consider this a 'novel' but more a nostalgic commentary. \\nEither way, it was an enjoyable read for our group after the heavier content of our last book, and the agreed 3 stars is a good indication that we found it worthwhile. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Memories for Sale is a novella by Karen Fowler. This is a story about a mother with a cancer diagnosis, an estranged daughter, a grandchild that has never been seen and a desire to make amends. Like many parents, Eleanor thinks that providing money for her granddaughter will make amends for never having seen her, so she decides to sell her collection of ceramics. Each ceramic item is tied to a memory, so she truly is putting her memories up for sale. The basic premise for the story is nice enough. The only character that the reader gets any true insight into is Eleanor, but as the main character that is acceptable. I found Memories for Sale to be a decent and quick read but one that was quickly forgotten after completion. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"This was the Arizona book in my new project to read a mystery from every state, by an author new to me. It's set in Tucson and the surrounding area. I know a lot of people who now live there so it was interesting to read about the setting, as well as the mystery. Trade Ellis is both a working rancher and a private investigator. This book, the first in the series, finds her being asked to investigate a homicide or perhaps more than one, with the victims being members of the cheerleading team during her own high school years. The class reunion is coming up and Trade is fascinated by the huge changes some classmates have undergone. The solution is quite surprising. One thing I really liked about this book was that Trade does not drop everything to pursue the killer -- she still has other commitments including her ranch work, a cow-penning contest, and making tamales for a coming-of-age ceremony. (100 dozen tamales! She does it with her cousin, but still -- I'm impressed.) I thought it was a good device to have her already be a PI but not have been in on a homicide investigation before -- it allowed her to make mistakes without seeming stupid. I'm sure I will read more books in this series. \",\n",

Secondly, I rarely read biographies. Though there was the wish to read this one for one simple reason - to catch a glimpse into the mind of such a creative person.\\nAs much as I don't know the series and characters from TV I was hooked from page one and couldn't put the book down. Postgate's writing is full of humour, warmth and quirkiness, and you immediately realize that he's not only inventive, but also a fabulous storyteller. Sharing memories from early childhood, all through creating his famous characters, straight to his private life, this is one of the most engaging books I've read in a while. I can't believe he never considered a career as a writer too, he'd been cut out for it for sure.\\nObviously, I wished I had the chance to actually watch his ideas come to live on the screen! For now it's enough that this book made Bagpuss and the rest of the bunch come to live in my mind.\\nIn short: A delightful and moving memoir of a truly creative man! \",\n",

Check out her Review)\\nWhat I Loved: Toil and Trouble really is Jolie\\'s life in a nutshell! I really can\\'t write much without giving it away so this will be a general review. This book rocked the house in a fun, spunky kind of way. I liked the first one (gave it a 3) but all those little things that were missing from it are in this one in spades. Jolie, bless her little wiccan heart, is just as much of a beautiful mess as she was in the first one. She gets into bigger trouble, her romances are more tangled than ever, and she does a great job of keeping it together even though you know she just wants to fall apart. I love the men of the book and yes I am talking about the two biggies: Rand and Sinjin. I liked the roles they played and I think they were both essential to the building of Jolie\\'s character and giving her the \"umph\" she needed. The time \"warp\" is my favorite part of the book and I think gives you essential information for the series. Everything just meshes together very well and you can\\'t turn the page fast enough to see what is going to happen.\\nWhat I Liked: Pretty much all the world building, secondary character building, and plot pacing. The actual nuts and bolts of the book were done really well!\\nComplaints: None\\nWhy I gave it a 4: This book I will read again as I am sure I missed some things because it was packed with information. It was a really good read.\\nWho I would recommend it too: UF fans and maybe PNR if you can handle the two guys aspect. I would say read the first one before this one though, you might be a little lost of you don\\'t.\\nAuthor Website: \\nOther\"&gt;http://www.urbanfantasynovels.com/\\nOther books in this series:\\nFire Burn and Cauldron Bubble\\nToil and Trouble\\n ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Received this book through librarything. As a SF&amp;F lover, vampire novels are slightly outside my own comfort range (though thanks to the liking thereof of my wife I'm often confronted with it...). I liked the slighlty new (at least to me) approach towards vampires and the how and what of them.\\nThe book is an easy read (though there are some typo's / mistakes in them that can be annoying...) but.... I do understand the need to cut large books into parts and I also understand the marketing value of having a cliff-hanger at the end of a book but... this book was very short (read it in under an hour) and actually only one thing happens, girl falls in love, boy falls in love (and again), girl finds out boy 1 is vampire and boy 2 is vampire hunter. Girl runs away, comes back, book stops... Even the teenagers / YA's it is aimed at must (or should?) require a bit more substance (or have I grown that old already?)\\nNext time, please finish the plot properly before ending book 1! \",\n",

Throughout the book he emphasizes about the morals and principles instilled in him by his parents and also about his christian calling and how they helped in shaping the person that he was/is today.\\nOverall - a very inspiring and feel-good book. And you don't have to know football to read the book - he explains pretty clearly about the various plays, people and games as and when he refers to them in the book, however I would say knowledge of the game would surely help you appreciate the book better because most of the people and incidents referred to in the book are involved with football.\\nThe one thing I really liked about this book is that it is NOT preachy!!!\\nMy take on this book: This is a good, inspiring book and recommended particularly for people who have even the slightest interest in American football. \",\n",

I didn't really start to pick up speed until chapter 16!\\nThe other problem I had was with the constant shift between perspectives. Not to mention that the characters seemed poorly developed. I understand that an author wants to maintain a sense of mystery by alluding to something that has happened in the past. But when the author does this frequently throughout the beginning of the book and then fails to develop many of those situations, I feel cheated. I was confused by so many things that had happened in the past, and in different countries. This was especially so when a new chapter opened by referring to a weapon from the past. The characters discussed the weapon in such a way that made me feel like I was supposed to know all about it. I had to rapidly scan through the ensuing paragraphs to get a feel for what was supposed to be going on.\\nAll in all, even though the premise was interesting, I felt that the book actions could have been handled much better. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'In the aftermath of World War I, a thirteen-year-old girl discovers a peculiar talent. When Emily cracks a bone in her ankle, the popping sound appears to come from midair. She reveals her discovery to Michael, her twin brother, and the two hatch a scheme to convince the neighborhood kids that the mysterious knocking comes from the afterlife. In a time when so many families  including her own  have lost someone, people are ripe to believe in spirit knocking. Emilys talent is soon discovered by the adults in town  and things go far beyond either Emily or Michael could have imagined.\\nI am faced, once again, with trying to explain why I didnt love a book that I found exceptionally well-written. It seems that it is harder for me to write reviews on books that I feel middling about; its easier to explain why I really dislike a book or why I simply adored it. And again, it comes down to whether or not I can emotionally connect with the story or anyone in it. I felt detached from the characters  almost as if I was watching their story from afar. I wanted to become lost in the story, but it didnt have that effect on me.\\nIn some ways, the house at Ravenswood is the main character of the book, as the chapters involving Michael and Emily are interspersed with scenes that occurred in the houses past. These scenes werent given chronologically, however, and so I found them disorienting.\\nI did find it fascinating how many of the adults were willing to believe that Emily truly had a talent for spirit knocking, especially as it was a real craze that occurred around that time. I also found the dynamic between the twins and their mother intriguing, as I cant imagine having so little knowledge of what my children were doing with their free time.\\nThe Girl Who Would Speak for the Dead is Paul Elworks first novel, and while I didnt love it, I enjoyed his writing style enough to watch for his next one.

       "  'comment': 'My first attempt at reading manga and from an interest point of view, a successful first effort. Starting from the rear of the book and reading right to left took a little getting used to, but it was surprising how quickly you adapt. The story itself follows Light Yagami as he finds the Death Note - a notebook dropped by a death god. The book allows the owner to kill anyone whose name is written within its pages. Light, feeling this is his opportunity to rid the world of criminals and bullies fully embraces the idea of the Death Note. That is until his actions come to the attention of the mysterious figure of L, the legendary and unknown detective. This brief synopsis hardly does the story justice. What you think is a book solely based on horror becomes a subtle complex battle of wills and a debate between right and wrong. Enjoyed this alot more than I thought I would. The opening half a dozen pages I really wasnt sure, but the rather simple plot frays off into new areas which I never imagined at the start. The facets of the Death Note are revealed slowly through the book as opposed to a mass download of information and just enhances the delicate storytelling. Intriguing and enjoyable. ',\n",

Both of her best friends, Andy the sweet, smart boy next door and Travis the popular football playing boy also next door, already know where they are heading after they finish school. But Jermain has yet to decide on a career path. When a student starts acting strange and is then followed shortly by other students and teachers, Jermain puts aside her worries about the future and begins searching for the cause of the schools sudden zombie behavior. With her secretly-crushing-on-her best friends at her side, she sets her purposeful sights on figuring out this mystery detective style.\\nDetective Jermain was a great graphic novel that had me glued to the pages. It was more than just a thick comic book. It had a story with enough dialogue and narration to keep you entertained the whole time while reading.\\nImmaculate Jermain was a great character. She was the clue putter-togetherer, the Velma in the Scooby-Doo equation. Though she was a great sleuth, she was unable to notice that the two people closest to her liked her. Maybe not completely realistic, but her pure surprise and slight uneasiness toward their statement made me like her even more. Jermain had an enthusiasm that just drew you in and instantly made you want to believe that you would have done the same thing in her place.\\nI loved how this book felt like a modern Scooby-Doo mystery aimed towards teenagers. They gathered clues and tried piecing together any possibilities. You couldnt even guess who the culprit was until Jermain (the Velma) gave the big reveal at the end. The author completely pulled it off with a fun and fast Who-dun-it air.\\nI suggest this graphic novel to everyone, especially YA mystery/suspense lovers.\\nDate Reviewed: November 17th, 2008 ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd is a wonderfully rich story about finding rebirth redemption and the journey each of us must take to get there. Enter Lilly, a young motherless girl. Hungry for love Lilly spends most of her time in her daydreams, desperately trying to escape her lonely existence and an abusive father. Her only friend, their housekeeper Rosaleen, is the closest thing she has to a mother. In this coming of age story, set against the backdrop of the racial tensions of the 1960s, Kidd takes us on a quest in which Lilly must learn to live not in her dreams but in the real world where even the people who love you leave.\\nThrough a series of, seemingly, almost pre-destined events Lilly must decide does she escape now and find her future or remain and stay a prisoner of her longings? Armed with little more than the clothes on their backs, Lilly and Rosaleen flee their hometown and head for Tiburon, South Carolina to discover the mother she never knew. Enchanted by the ragged mementos her mother left behind, an old picture of her mother and a Black Madonna figurine, the women land in the laps of the beekeeping Boatwright sisters. Certain that the Sisters possess the answers she seeks, Lilly prevails upon eldest sister, August, to take them in. Despite their tenuous existence, both she and Rosaleen bloom under the care of the Boatwright sisters. The delightful clan of women and an almost romance transform Lillys once sorrowful experience into one almost idyllic. Yet Kidd knows that to end the story there would not only cheat the readers but her characters as well. She knows that the truths of life await us all and that Lilly must learn the truths of life and that real living is not as simple as the stories she creates and neither are people. \\nDespite the tragedy woven throughout, The Secret Life of Bees is at its heart a story of great faith, love, and forgiveness. In which Kidds characters are all faced with their own challenges where they must forgive their past in order to truly live. It is through watching them, and experiencing their love that Lilly learns to accept her own tragedies. The death and life of Lillys mother long shrouded in fairy tales and mystery finally comes to light. Lilly must confront the truth and accept it to become the woman she wants to be. \\nWe are all faced with these challenges and certainly more than once in our lifetime. We are all hindered by our past, but eventually we must decide: do we forgive and move on or do we live in limbo where redemption and rebirth are not possible? In real life, people make mistakes. The question Kidd asks the reader is, do we choose to love that person anyway for who they are? Life is not black and white, good or bad, right or wrong. Sometimes, lifes outcomes are determined by what we can accept and the choice to really and truly live.\\nThis was my second time to read the book, and while many will find this an intense story to read as so much of it centers on death and tragic circumstances. I very much felt it was a story of rebirth and redemption for all of the characters, leading us to wonder, how many rebirths are possible in a lifetime? Perhaps, the number is infinite if we can only open our hearts and minds. I especially loved Kidds rich portrayal of the wonderful relationships that exist between women. Throughout time, women have banned to together to form families and that is just what happens in the Secret Life of Bees. While they may not be a conventional family, it is their ability to create faith and family no matter the skin color that will surely capture your heart as it captured mine. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'This beautiful but tragic story is based on actual events relating to the slave Gabriel, who had the temerity, in 18th Century Virginia, to dream of freedom.\\nThe author imagines Gabriels interior life, based on what is known about his actual circumstances. Born into slavery on a tobacco plantation in 1776, Gabriel was taught to read and write. As he grew up and acquired the skills of a blacksmith, he was also hired out to Richmond to bring in more money for his master. There he interacted with free blacks and white laborers and heard not only the ideas of freedom and equality touted by the American Revolution, but of the successful uprising in Saint Domingue led by black slaves that culminated in the end of slavery there. Why, he asked, couldnt that happen in America?\\nHe recruited others, and worked on obtaining weapons. Their rebellion was scheduled to start August 30, 1800. Not only did a torrential rain intervene, but two slaves confessed the plan to their masters. Many of the conspirators were caught, some were executed, and some were exiled to other states. A rare few were pardoned. Gabriel of course was not among them, and was hanged on October 10.\\nMs. Amateau tries to recreate not only Gabriels thoughts during his life, but the reactions of his mother and later his wife, Nanny, to the exceptional man that Gabriel grew up to be. Nanny, as courageous as her husband, also participated in the planning for the rebellion. The author includes reproductions, interspersed throughout the text, of documents from the time relating to Gabriels rebellion, capture, sentencing, and execution. \\nEvaluation: The plotline of this book and of Gabriels true story were only bearable for me because, unlike a movie or television production, there are no visuals of violence, and no actual faces I could attach to those who would perpetuate slavery (with the notable exception of James Monroe, then Governor of Virginia). It is meant to be a book you can bear, and yet  it is hard. The prose is lovely, and explicit evils of slavery are kept to a minimum, but the pain and awfulness of slavery cannot be hidden. Nor should it be! It is a real enough story, and should be told; should be borne. Research notes are appended to the text.\\nWhile this book is being marketed as Middle Grade, I didnt see any reason why it could not also or alternatively be labeled Young Adult or Adult.\\nHighly recommended!\\nNote: On August 30, 2007 Governor Tim Kane informally pardoned Gabriel, saying that his motivation had been \"his devotion to the ideals of the American revolution  it was worth risking death to secure liberty.\" ',\n",

Titanic: an Illustrated History provided them, and in spades. The narrative is but a small part of the book, and I read it within about an hour. \\nBut it was the paintings by Ken Marshall that were truly amazing, even better than the most detailed photos would have been. His foldout cutaway illustration of the Titanic revealed the relationship between various parts of the ship and made it clear why so many third-class passengers died. The various photos, many from the Titanics sister ship, Olympic, helped complete Titanics story.\\nA single diagram of the Lost and Saved, categorized by gender and class, vividly shows how those two variables mattered in who survived and who didnt.

But he's a loner, eschewing friends, uncaring about making enemies and flouting Guild customs and politics. He finds that he has finally stepped too far and crossed those in the Guild who have the power to keep him from the sea--the only thing he has a passion for in life. Then he finds himself kidnapped, forced to serve as Pilot on a Black Ship, a vessel operating outside the law, captained by a man stripped of his license and thought mad, and crewed by the dregs and the cursed of seafaring society.\\nTaking the name Thorn, he faces killer storms, ravenous creatures of the deep, a mutinous crew, enemy ships, pirates, death magic, and the horrific spawn-inducing magic of the sylveth that is the source of power and danger in the sea. But he also, surprisingly finds a sense of brotherhood among the outcast crew of the ship.\\nThe story is full of page-turning action and adventure, harrowing danger and narrow escapes. The characters are compelling, with horrific pasts, and they all develop in fascinating ways. The world is equally intriguing, with its magic and gods and various warring societies and political intrigue.\\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love historical sea adventure, as well as fantasy, so the mix was a happy one for me. Thorn was a strong and memorable character. The world was well-developed and was full of mystery and dangerous magic. Although the book ends without a cliff-hanger, the voyage is not complete and there are story threads that need to be concluded. I sincerely hope the adventures of Thorn and Captain Plusby and the Black Ship Eidolon continue in a sequel. I did not want to leave this world and these amazing characters. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"This book, by Albert Marrin, tells about the discover of the cure to smallpox. The book starts out by telling how the spanish conquistadors brought this dreadful disease to the Aztecs when they visited South America. It progresses, telling about the horror stories of the disease, about how it inspired terror in the hearts of people around the world. Then Edward Jenner came along. Edward Jenner first worked as a simple surgeon, studying under John Hunter. When Hunter could not teach him anymore, Edward finally achieved the title of Dr. Jenner. Smallpox had interested Jenner for some time, but he could not figure out a way to cure it. Back then, people thought it came from foul air, or a vicious quality that a child got from its mothers blood when in the womb. Dr. Jenner used the standard method to treat smallpox, which was inoculation. He would give the patients small cases of smallpox and then the patients would be free from any other smallpox attack. But Dr. Jenner wasn't satisfied. \\n He knew the horrors of inoculation, having experienced it himself. People just inoculated were put in a room, crammed together, sleeping on the floor until they were deemed well enough to go back home. Jenner didn't want anyone to experience that. So he decided to find a new way. As Jenner went about his observations, he noted that milkmaids never got smallpox. The reason for that, they said, was because they had already had the cowpox. Cowpox is a mild disease where an infection appears on the cow's udders and teats. The milkmaids, as they milked the cows, would contract the disease too. But they would eventually get better, and keep on milking cows. Jenner went on a mission to find the reason for this. He eventually found it. The cowpox is not nearly as dangerous as smallpox, but it is enough, so that when smallpox enters, the immune system recognizes it and destroys it before it can wreck damage. Jenner conducted experiments, and all of them proved to be successful. Whoever he inoculated with cowpox, would be free of smallpox! With this new discovery, Jenner excitedly told other people. The public saw it as a much safer and less terrifying experience than the other inoculation. Soon, more and more people were getting inoculated. At the end of the book, the author tells about the preventions against smallpox in effect today. \\n \\n In my opinion, this was a very interesting book. I didn't think that it would be that interesting because it was one of my school books, but I learned a lot from it. It showed me how dangerous something invisible to the human eye can be, and the genius of the human mind. It was a little bit confusing in some places, but overall, it was a worthwhile read.\",\n",

Her mother abandoned her. She was sexually abused many times as a child. She essentially had to raise herself and her sister. When she unsurprisingly acted out, instead of anyone actually caring, she was locked up in a series of mental institutions for most of her teenage years.\\nBecause she was tomboyish, the doctors focused on that, in some cases forcing her to wear makeup every day as part of her treatment. She suffered from depression the entire time she was locked up, was raped several times by male patients, and her parents barely kept in contact with her, yet the doctors continued to focus on the fact that she didn\\'t act like their idea of what a girl should be. She was looked on with suspicion for not having sex with the male patients, as most of the other boys and girls paired up. She was punished for having a female best friend, as they thought the relationship was inappropriate.\\nThis book is really, really depressing to read and basically will make you hate the medical establishment. This quote from the last chapter really sums it up best:\\n\"I still wonder why I wasn\\'t treated for my depression, why no one noticed I\\'d been sexually abused, why the doctors didn\\'t seem to believe that I\\'d come from a home with physical violence. Why the thing they cared about the most was whether I acted the part of a feminine young lady. The shame is that the effects of depression, sexual abuse, violence: all treatable.

Or, she thought it was a good ending, when in fact it was a cheat. It allowed for too much neat tying up of messy lives.\\nI do not agree with the epilogue in which Jesse became a police officer, and, my second reading, when I know that it is Kate who asked not to take Anna's kidney in the first place, changes the entire tone and perspective of the book.

       "  'comment': 'Book Info: Genre: Procedural murder mystery/urban fantasy cross\\nReading Level: Adult\\nRecommended for: Cat lovers, people who like mysteries, urban fantasy, great twists\\nTrigger Warnings: Murder\\nAnimal Abuse: tortoise murder, catnapping\\nMy Thoughts: Ive been looking forward to this book for months, ever since hearing about it in the authors newsletter back around Thanksgiving. I love cats, I love mysteries, I love urban fantasy... what could go wrong?\\nShawn is awesome. I love the way he talks to Comet (which is pretty much how I talk to my cats), and I love his sense of humor. When he meets the small, but very aggressive, Sarah Baio, he had a great reaction. Shawn grinned, and tried not to say that she was adorable and he wanted to put her in his pocket. She would probably punch him in the throat. What is awesome about that is that he realized her strength and could still see the woman behind at the same time without some idiotic need to try to protect her in some way. I also loved Shawns reaction to loads of strange cats showing up in his place, which was essentially, Im going to need more food. He doesnt even consider putting them out for a moment, and I just thought that was awesome!\\nSpeaking of the mysteriously appearing cats, they are described as big, fluffy, dark brown, and having mismatched eyes. It sounds like maybe Maine Coon cats (since he called them coon cats), and I wanted to try to find a picture, but I cannot find a solid brown Maine Coon, let alone a brown one with mismatched eyes: those are usually found in white cats. The only solid brown cats of which Im aware are Havana Browns.\\nThe Sylvains are a real piece of work. I felt really badly for poor Haviland having to deal with that family of jerks. Some of the things they did... wow. Shawn Dangers family was almost as bad. The characters in this book are a lot of fun, and the interactions are so funny.\\nUnlike Nina Posts other books, this one isnt quite as silly overall (not that this is a bad thing either way), but it is still very humorous. If you like Nina Posts style, be sure to check out her other books, Last Condo Board of the Apocalypse , Last Donut Shop of the Apocalypse , and One Ghost Per Serving . Links on the titles will take you to my reviews on sites where formatting is allowed.\\nRecommended for people who love cats, for people who enjoy a good mystery, for people who love a funny story, and for people who love a terrific twist at the end of the book. Understanding of quantum physics is optional. Great fun!\\nDisclosure: I received a copy of this e-book from the author. No review was requested, but Im happy to provide one. All opinions are my own.\\nSynopsis: On the verge of losing himself in his work, a homicide detective investigates the murder of a reclusive heiress, but when he discovers a window to another universe and dozens of cats begin appearing out of thin ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"After reading this book the Codex Alera has officially become my favorite of the two series written by Jim Butcher. This book takes place roughly 2 years after Academ's Fury and Tavi is a long way from the boy that he was in Furies of Calderon. He is a very strong character, filled with wit, intelligence and a deep understanding of the world around him. He is often able to look below the surface of what something (or someone) appears to be and figure out what actually is. The writing is superb and Butcher really knows how to play the suspense card, cutting away from one character's narrative just at the right moment to heighten the suspense and make you want to read faster to get back and see what will happen next.\\nIf you like Fantasy...or heck if you just like an amazing story...then this is a series that I highly recommend to one and all!\\nhttp://tickettoanywhere.blogspot.com/2008/01/cursors-fury-by-jim-butcher.html \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This is an excellent book  gorgeously written with evocative imagery, nicely paced and unpredictable, with sympathetic character portraits of even those who might seem unlikeable at first. Anatoly Sukhanov is a well-off and respected Soviet critic and editor with a seemingly perfect family. A series of small incidents unhinge him and lead him to revaluate his choices and his past. He remembers his childhood in the 1930s and through the war in straitened circumstances, his development as an artist, his relationship with his wife Nina and his decision to turn to inoffensive articles and books. The book shifts between the gritty realism of the past, the cushy present life of Sukhanov and the surreal life in Sukhanovs dreams. The surreal aspects of the book are handled very well and eventually Sukhanovs past, present and hallucinations collide.\\nSukhanov hardly seems like a character to inspire sympathy. For all his Soviet credentials, he is nothing so much as a petty smug bourgeois. He can barely remember the names of the help and is cold to those out of favor. Hes easily offended, self-righteous and terribly rude, traits easily seen in the contrast between him and the other characters  tactful Nina, his kind daughter Ksenya, his eager-to-please cousin and his old friend Lev Belkin. At a party to celebrate his father-in-law, a successful but clearly pandering painter, Sukhanov runs into Belkin and shakes him off. From there he begins to have flashes from the past and is disconcerted when a long-lost cousin comes to stay. However, even at the beginning, the reader cant wholly dismiss Sukhanov. He genuinely loves his family and is proud of his children. As his world crumbles around him, he is hurt and confused as much as whiny and angry. Hes done what was expected of him and cant adapt to the changes of the 1980s. This is a universal conflict though Sukhanov obviously is on the wrong side of history. But the flashbacks - the deprived childhood of Sukhanov, his intense fear of being different and his previous uncertain days as an avant-garde artistic radical - make his current contentment understandable. Its easy to condemn those who collaborated with the repressive Soviet machine and churned out dull, uncritical praises of the system but the choice that Grushin depicts isnt easy. Its not a choice between artistic greatness and conforming  Grushin questions whether the art that Sukhanov abandoned was even worth it. She is also critical of those who put art ahead of everything else and has some of the characters who made decisions based on this ideal not happy with their choices later on. \\nThe surreal aspects of the novel are well-done. At first, it starts out a bit predictable with Sukhanov having symbolic dreams, for example one of Nina flying away from him as she becomes distant in real life. Later, though, images of flying appear in the past and present, and hover over the plot as symbols. Sukhanovs paintings in the past also provide another surreal view of life. In both realities, characters analyze the surreal art of Dali and Chagall. Some of the events in Sukhanovs present life become distinctly nightmarish  a claustrophobic party that seems to have materialized out of nowhere, a neverending train ride and struggle to get home. The past and present bleed together. Grushin uses first person in the past and third person in the present but as the story moves to its end, there is less distinction between the tenses. Some artists turned to absurdism, symbolism or fantasticism in response to the Soviet system and though it happens here, it is also a response to Sukhanovs situation  he survived the USSR under Stalin and reversals under Khrushchev but is now trapped by the increased freedom. He did in some measure come to believe in his conformity - he was never so cynical as to pretend to abandon his art but keep at it. Sukhanov went along with the prevailing current and had a wife he loved, a comfortable life, successful children. Now he learns that parts of his life are a sham, his wife is impossibly distant from him, both children find him a disappointment and he is behind the times at his job. What else can he do but fully embrace the absurdity of the situation? The book is perhaps a bit too neat in its comparisons. For example, Sukhanovs two children provide rebukes to him but diametrically opposite ones. His daughter Ksenya is liberal, intellectual and warmhearted (though she feels some contempt and pity for her father) and rejects him for his pettiness and conformity. His son Vasily is cold and self-interested  he scorns his father for not using his position and connections to climb even farther. Sukhanov also has his match in an artist who didnt sell out like he did. His cousin is a threat both professionally and personally. There is a surreal explanation given as an alternative for the events and I really liked it  could explain some of the matching. ',\n",

       "  'comment': '<b>Originally posted at </b>http://www.wherepenmeetspaper.com&gt;\\nWilliam Boyd (b. 1952) is a Scottish novelist and screenwriter. In 1983, he was selected as one of Britains top twenty young British novelists. Though his novels, An Ice-Cream War, Brazzaville Beach, and The Blue Afternoon, have been shortlisted for many major prizes, he has not garnered much acclaim. On April 11, 2012 Boyd announced he is writing the next James Bond novel, set in the year 1969.\\n<b>Three Parts Make a Whole</b>\\nIf youve ever seen the period-based television show, Downton Abbey, you know how riveting and intentional drama can be. Often enveloped by the lives of those in the fictitious drama, I was delighted to find a First World War period novel. Caught up in the throws of World War I, we see a protagonist go through self-enlightenment, while we wait for the sun to rise in his life.\\nWaiting for Sunrise is part period piece, part psychological journey, and part war/spy novel. Experimentally written, the switches in topic, tone, and even narrative mode dont deter from the readability of the novel, but rather enhance it.\\nThe protagonist, Lysander Rief, is warned in the early pages of the book about the dangers of the Austrian capital, Vienna. Even though the city seems like a safe place to explore, below the surface is a giant river of temptation for Lysander.\\nThis placethis Pension Kriwanekis just like Vienna. You have the world of Frau K on top. So nice and so pleasant, everybody smiling politely, nobody farting or picking their nose. But below the surface the river is flowing, dark and strong.What river?The river of sex (27).\\n<b>Transferring Jobs</b>\\nLysander is in danger of going under. As an English actor, he traveled to Vienna to seek treatment from a psychologist named Bensimon. While in the waiting room, he meets two people, one of which, Hettie Bull, becomes his newest lover. He also meets Alwyn Munro, who is a military official at the British consulate. By meeting Alwyn as well as talking with Dr. Bensimon, Lysander becomes interested in the spy world.\\nIn his talks with his therapist, Lysander learns of a theory called parallelism, furthering his interest in being a ruthless and ingenious spy hunter.\\nLets say that the world is in essence neutralflat, empty, bereft of meaning and significance. Its us, our imaginations, that make it vivid, fill it with colour, feeling, purpose and emotion. Once we understand this we can shape our world in any way we want. In theory...I hesitate to say this, and I vary rarely make this leap, but I have a feeling Parallelism will cure you, Mr Rief, I really do (49).\\nParallelism, perhaps the largest theme in the novel, closely ties into Lysanders addictions. As Bensimon suggests, the individual has the ability to change their world for the better, if they so choose. Lysander has the chance to change his addictions, to better his life, and to move away from a life of frivolity and meaningless sex. Through parallelism, Lysander has a chance to make his life work. However, Lysander doesnt change his addictions, but rather his employ.\\n<b>Many Realities</b>\\nWhat ends up happening in the novel is a collage of espionage and global war, sex and temptation. When World War I breaks out, Rief, instead of fulfilling his theatric aspirations, is called by Munro to transform himself into a spy. Lysander is sent on a mole hunt that takes him all around the world, eventually landing him in London. \\nMeanwhile, Lysander falls in love with yet another woman, further entrenching him in the river of sex mentioned in the first few pages of the novel. The theory of parallelism runs rampant in the novel, transforming Lysander into a spy, yet his addiction to and problems with sex still somehow remain. Parallelism isnt a thorough reality for Rief.\\nIf youve ever seen the television series Downton Abbey and would like to read a book that is eerily similar to the First World War depiction therein, William Boyds Waiting for Sunrise is about as close as one can get. William Boyd has been asked to write the next James Bond thriller, so that gives you a good idea of the spy narrative within. Even though theres a lot going on, Waiting for Sunrise combines complicated, intellectual intrigue and adventure to make something worth reading. \\n<b>Originally posted at </b>http://www.wherepenmeetspaper.com&gt; ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"There is a reason they call Agatha Christie the Grand Dame of Mystery. This story is a great example of her work. In a quiet country village, a woman dies - is it suicide? Next, a wealthy widower is stabbed to death in his study. Suspects and motives abound, but the police just can't seem to sort the matter out. Enter the great detective, Hercule Poirot. \\nI am a big fan of Christie's Poirot novels. The character of the detective is just so funny, his appearance so unexpected, that you can't help be surprised right along with his audience when he takes the random facts you never bothered to notice and turns them into a solution to the mystery. \\nThis is a classic murder mystery in its pure form. There are no side romances or steamy sex scenes. There is no impending doom to keep you in suspense. What you will find in this book is a great whodunnit, as you try to figure it all out. I did not see the ending coming until just a few pages from the last. \\nChristie's shrewd understanding of character reminds me a bit of Jane Austen. Even as you can't help but be amused and annoyed with Mrs. Bennet, the extraneous characters in the Murder of RA will keep you well entertained.\\nI liked this book a lot and would recommend it to all of you out there who love mysteries for the mystery, and who enjoy thinking you might be a good detective. \",\n",

In her sleeping cabinet behind the rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost-how the world went from amusement parks, movie theatres, birthday parties, fathers and mothers to ash and dust, scars, permanent burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the militia to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can no longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.\\nThere are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects their healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels isolated and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped phrase suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her.\\nWhen Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.\\nI received Pure by Julianna Baggott from Netgalley to review. I really enjoyed reading this dystopian tale, it was well written and well thought out. I loved reading the mixture of perspectives from Lyda &amp; Partridge, inside the Dome and Pressia &amp; Bradwell, outside the Dome. The only part of Pure that I didn't like was the ending, for me it didn't fit in with the rest of the book, it seemed too simple and a bit odd. My favourite character was Pressia because of her resourcefulness and determination. I love the cover of Pure, the blue butterfly surrounded by ash within the Dome implies that whichever side of the Dome the characters are on, they are trapped in one way or another. \\nAvailable at Amazon.co.uk. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"This is the fourth book in the Madeline Black series. It was a solid installment in this series, if not the best one in the series. The fifth book in the series, Black City, is scheduled for a Feb 2013 release. \\nMadeline Black finds out from Lucifer that she is pregnant with Gabriel's baby. Now she not only has to evade numerous assassination attempts from the Faerie court, she also has to hunt down her father to revenge Gabriel, and keep her unborn child out of Lucifer's hands. All of this while she continues to grieve for Gabriel. \\nThis story was fast-paced and has a lot going on. Definitely more of an urban fantasy than PNR. These are always interesting books because, while they dont always have a clear story or objective, there is always a lot happening and its engaging.\\nMaddie has embraced her power and isnt afraid to destroy everything in her path to get to a goal. This book is interesting because she is forced to temper her behavior slightly to allow for her pregnancy. I do enjoy how powerful she has become and how she is always kicking someones butt.\\nMy favorite character in this series continues to be Beezle the gargoyle; he just adds so much witty banter and humor to the story. Simon and JB are also running support for Maddie and it was great to have them be part of the story as well.\\nThe other character that features in the story that I was surprised to enjoy is Nathaniel. He is in the story a lot because he is assigned by Lucifer to guard Maddie. He is becoming a more complex character and you couldnt help but feel a bit bad for him at times.\\nWe delve a lot deeper into the faerie realms in this book and I really enjoyed all the crazy faerie creatures that try to hunt Maddie down. There are some seriously creepy faerie creatures in this book and I loved reading about them.\\nI do like that they were some big revelations with Maddies character; I think this book paved the way for her to really grow and change in future books. She is finally embracing her godlike heritage.\\nMy only complaint is that Maddie is a bit too lucky and powerful and is continually getting out of situations she shouldn't be able to get out of. She tends to blast her way through situations that she could probably talk her way out of. While I enjoy the action scenes; I do feel like Maddies overzealousness and crazy luck is a bit over the top. \\nOverall I really enjoyed this story. Fans of the this series should be happy with this installment. We meet some new and interesting fairy creatures. We also get to see Maddie go through some big changes. Maddies continual ability to escape impossible situations unscathed does get a bit old, but I do enjoy the fast pace of the story and all of the interesting characters. I recommend this series to fans of urban fantasy. There are better urban fantasy series out there, but this is still a solid one that I enjoy reading. \",\n",

Now Stormlord Shale must stretch his powers to bring rain, or his people will die - if they don't meet a Reduner knife first. However, Shale can't hold out alone for much longer, and those who seek to exploit him are closing in. Rainlord Kaneth has spurned these politics for war, and plans to defeat the Reduner leader from his desert stronghold. But there are spies in Kaneth's camp. Terelle has been Shale's secret weapon until now, covertly boosting his powers. But her Uncle's magic compels her to travel to distant Khromatis - and if she disobeys him it will destroy her. Yet Khromatis gave the desert its first Stormlord, so Terelle may find hope there as well as great danger ...\\nThis is the final book in this trilogy; and I am sorry to leave this world and its people. The resolution of so many intricate plots, intrigues and relationships was handled skilfully and Larke managed to introduce some extra twists and surprises in this volume. We finally get to see beyond the Quartern to the mysterious Khromatis, which shatters not a few preconceptions of a number of characters. \\nShale and Terelle have grown and matured; and the Quatern is changing. The scene is set for a return visit at some time in the future.\",\n",

She is such an unreliable narrator that the reader really can't know what actually happened or continues to happen. I believe Mathilda has some sort of rather serious breakdown after her sister's death, and that her mental state continues to be very precarious, although I am not sure her parents are aware of this. Her father is greatly concerned about her mother, but doesn't seem to notice his remaining daughter is not coping well at all. I wanted this book to be like The Lovely Bones, but it's more like an episode of Intervention, if you gave the addict the camera. \",\n",

Mahfoez die in 1988 de Nobelprijs voor literatuur won heeft met deze trilogie een indringend beeld geschetst van het leven van een familie in Caro tussen de beide wereldoorlogen. Alle drie de delen lezen zeer prettig weg en blijven boeien.\\nIk moet eerlijk zeggen dat ik houd van lijvige romans die een hele maatschappij beschrijven aan de hand van een of meer families. Het is in feite een voortzetting van de 19e eeuws romantraditie met boeken als \"Oorlog en vrede *****\"van Tolstoi. Soortgelijke kolossale romans die een hele maatschappij behandelen zijn oa.: \"A suitable boy *****\" van Vikram Seth over India in de jaren vijftig, \"Buru-tetralogie *****\" van Pramoedya Anata Toer over Nederlands-Indi aan het begin van de 20e eeuw en \"The family Moskat *****\" van Isaac Bashevis Singer over een familie in het getto van Warschau in de eerste helft van de 20e eeuw. De enige Nederlandse romancyclus waar ik aan moet denken is \"De tandeloze tijd ****\" van A.F.Th. van der Heijden. Voor al deze romans geldt dat ze zeer fors zijn en dat je er heel wat uren leesplezier aan hebt.\\nUItgelezen: maandag 26 maart 2001 ',\n",

The majority of the book is narrated by Vytautas Vargalis, an old man working in a library. Largely due to having spent a long time as a prisoner of war, he's extremely paranoid, and often hard to follow. Later the story is taken up by other, equally confusing narrators, who often contradict one another. In the end, it's not altogether clear what really happened.\\nI learned a lot about Lithuania by searching for various historical references from this book. However, I can't really say that I enjoyed reading it. Apart from the difficult writing style, the various scenes of rape and murder were really not for me. \",\n",

       "  'comment': '5 novellas dating back from the mid 1930s (judging from copyright) from the writer of \"Day of the Triffids\".\\n\"Sleepers of Mars\" - the Russians and the British have landed on Mars, and encountered a dying race. The British escape, but the Russian rocket fails, stranding them there. The Martians help build the ship, and whilst the Russians are waiting, they explore the remnants of the civilisation, and stumble onto a secret. An accident and a poor decision by the doctor releases a catastrophic chain of events. This one hasnt specifically dated - designs of things arent hard and fast (except the one difference between the Russian and English rockets - 3 vs 4 fins) and the story itself is sound - it doesnt matter what nation you come from on earth, when you make a mistake that big on another planet, you have to face the consequences)\\n\"Worlds to barter\" It\\'s 1945, and a scientist with his assistant is performing some experiments when they are rudely interrupted by a crash next door. It\\'s the scientist\\'s decendant from 2145, telling a story of time travel, and deformed himans from the 53rd century who have travelled back to 2145 to demand that the current inhabitants swap places. Typos aside (the future traveller keeps changing his name, and his girlfriend keeps changing sex from \"he\" to \"she\"!) this is still a little flat in the narrative, though principal was good.\\n\"Invisible Monster\". The crash landing of a spaceship returning from Venus is witnessed by 3 friends out on a fishing trip. They got to investigate and hopefully rescue any survivors. However there is something invisible inhabiting the ship and one of the three friends is killed. The two remaining men head to the nearest town and there soon arrives an increasing number of people in an attempt to address the issue, through increasingly violent means. Finally the beast is blown up, but there are unpredicted consequences that only makes the situation worse. However, help is on the way, finding out not only how to make the alien(s) visible but how to kill them. Whilst some of the detail is gruesome, there is still a lack of tension and emotional depth in this story - there seems to be little reaction to the fact that one friend is dead, and the other has apparently disappeared forever.\\n\"The Man from Earth\". We\\'re back on Venus, with a human being kept in a cage, with a stark warning of his fellow humans to the people of Venus. Again, it\\'s a single person narration of how he\\'s come to be there, and this time it\\'s about how people use each other and the things people are prepared to do to get what they think they want. In the end Gatz realises that he\\'s the last human, and his fate is the same as that experienced in \"Sleepers of Mars\".\\n\"The Third Vibrator\" another story told after the event from one person to another. By this point this technique has become boring and repetitive. I suppose Wyndham uses it to keep the stories short, but when it all 5 stories are collected together and use the same format it shows a weakness. David is a scientist who has been sent to a psychiatric unit after smashing up his work, and he tells a story of believing he\\'s invented this \"vibrator\" before and has destroyed two worlds with it, and needed to destroy the vibrator before it destroyed this world too.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"4.5 STARS \\nDragonswood by Janet Lee Carey is a wondrously compelling and enchanted tale of magical realms, dragons, and life's unforeseen destiny. A journey (through pages) I did not regret! \\nI was taken aback when I realized that Dragonswood was written in a medieval/historical scene. I'm so use to reading the paranormal, urban fantasy and dystopian genres that are coming out these days that it was kind of nice to take a break. It usually takes a lot of convincing for me to enjoy fantasy/medieval era books, but I can say that this read was quite pleasant. I enjoyed connecting with Tess, trying to understand how hard it was in those times - to step out of the roles of a 'women'. Tess is a very likable character and impulsively voices out her opinions, but later paying for doing so with cuts and bruises. She is forced to do what is expected of her. And when a woman is seen to WANT or TRY to be an individual she is titled a witch and is sent to burn at the stake. The story can be predictable at times but the adventure was still entertaining. There wasn't really that much romance going on, which again was okay for me because I needed a break from the lovey dovey. The characters are well developed even the minor ones. I really liked how Janet wrote a tale that mingles human and fey with human and dragon - it's very creative! I kept thinking about The Season of The Witch mixed with Dragon Heart with a dash of classic fairy-tales. It's kind of hard to describe - Dragonswood is a great whimsical sit down and chill, perfect for a rainy day kind of read! *ready the popcorn* \\nThe ending is adorable! It sounds like there will be a sequel, and that there will be more action. I'll be looking forward to seeing more of Jackrun! \",\n",

It was fun to read and it worked new elements that I had never heard or seen before in a Cinderella story into the story line. The artwork was kind of muted and dark to go along with the almost depressing story line. When good things happen in the pictures, they get lighter. When the step family is treating her badly, the pictures are darker. I liked how the pictures went with the text. \\nI would use this to show students how to make pictures match text.

       "  'comment': 'I make it a point to avoid any reviews of books that I am reading to reviewbut I cant imagine that they dont all say similar things about Lit. The words that come to mind are brutally honestbut thats not quite right. Even though she recounts some truly horrifying events in her life, the effect isnt brutal. I suppose unflinchingly honest is closer...but even that doesnt capture the feeling of this book.\\nKarrs words just seem so human. She talks about such sad, hurtful and scary things in her lifeand though I am lucky enough to not have much real life experience with those events, they are told in such a way that I am able to relate to her and feel real empathy towards her. She makes terrible mistakes in her life, and yet, I certainly dont condemn her. Its as if shes laid herself out to the reader in such a way that one realizes that our forgiveness (while unnecessary) is far easier to earn than the forgiveness of her toughest enemyherself.\\nIts taken me so much effort just to do as medium-sh***y as Ive heretofore done. Just to drop out of college, stay alive, and have my teeth taken care of.\\nHer words have an interesting effectone can almost feel the Mary Karr experiencing the moment in the past  being watched over and commented on by the Mary Karr that exists in the present writing about that moment. Theres an essence of both women in the tone of the words, and both perspectives are heartfelt.\\nTouching that triangle of yellowed paper today is like sliding my hand into the glove of my seventeen-year-old hand. Through magic, there are the Iowa fields slipping by with all the wholesome prosperity they represent. And there is my mother, not yet born into the ziplock baggie of ash my sister sent me years ago with the frank message Mom  , written in laundry pen, since no one in our family ever stood on ceremony.\\nI felt a bit anxious as I read her storylike I was watching someone wander around on the freeway  I kept wanting to pull her away from the oncoming traffic and keep her safe; especially during the worst times.\\nI find myself squatting in the bedroom closet with two incongruent bottles, whiskey and Listerine  the latter with accompanying spit bowl. Despite the dark, it feels safe in here, leaning against the back wall with clothes before my face.\\nTheres such a ferocity to many of her feelings, you cant help but root for her to find her way out of the dark. And thats it, that instant. My life as Ive shaped it includes  for that instant only  the daddy I once loved more than beans and rice.\\nAnd theres a beauty to her words as well, especially when she is talking about her son. Maybe you could loan me some of the shine in your young head to clear up my leftover dark spaces. Just as youre blameless for the scorched part of your childhood, Im equally exonerated for my own mothers nightmare.\\nTowards the end of the book, I began to realize there was more to the title of the book than the slang definition of the word. I began to see that Karr was going to be successful at fighting off the dark. That instead of searching for the answer at the bottom of a bottle, she might find it in the depths of her soul.\\nThis book is a triumph of words and of spirit. And even though it involves finding religionthere isnt one preachy or false word about it. Its again the humanity, the honesty of her words that make them ring true.\\nTo experience the story of a person who goes from this: The warmth beaming from her face cant reach me. Im too bent over some rotted core, as if to protect it from her.\\nto this: Such vast quiet holds me, and the me Ive been so lifelong worried about shoring up just dissolves like ash in water. Just isnt. In its place is this clean air. Theres a space at the bottom of an exhale, a little hitch between taking in and letting out thats a perfect zero you can go into.\\nLitits a perfect title for this journey, fits both bookends of the story, and captures the true luminosity of Mary Karrs words.

       "  'comment': \"Have you ever heard of Paper Towns? I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book by John Green. This book was recommended by an online friend from my website. I am glad I finally read it. I found the story very entertaining. The story made me think about my time in high school.\\nPaper Towns is the story of teenagers and just them discovering things about themselves and their friends. How would you react if you just learned that your boyfriend and best girl friend were hooking up? Your friends knew but didn't bother to tell you? Would you just snap or would you do something like Margo Roth Spiegelman does in Paper Towns.\\nPaper Towns follows Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman on an adventure and mystery. Q is the good kid and doesn't do anything wrong. Margo is the adventurous type. Two different personalities that were friends when the were young yet have grown apart like so many of us do over time.\\nI suggest taking some time and pick up Paper Towns and just enjoy the adventure. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'PBS the website is similar in scope to PBS the television station. While PBS is not aimed only at children, it is aimed at the community and children are a part of that. To that end, clicking on \"parenting\" under \"topics\" leads to a wealth of information from cooking nutritious snacks to holiday ideas to highlighting things that parents do with or because of their children. PBS also has many articles and programming that children traditionally enjoy and I am not just talking about Sesame Street, but also history and nature. The website is laid out in a pretty straightforward way and is well designed. Parents will find plenty of articles and videos that they can watch with their children. This website is a great resource for kids doing various homework projects. A great place to become more connected to a great family oriented television channel. Highly Recommended. ',\n",

Grey armies, grey skies, and grey faces all represent the silence before and after the storm of WWII in Romania. The color in all this grimness comes through the drawings of a deaf/mute young man and the bond of friendship. Augustin (Tinu) goes to the city to find his childhood friend Safta and gain refuge from his utterly chaotic life. They are reunited in the hospital where Safta works as a nurse and where Tinu almost dies.\\nThis is a quiet book that speaks volumes about isolation. Events unfold slowly but surely as Tinu relates the horror of war in the only way he can - through his pictures of despair. \"When Tinu drew a room he drew it empty. He drew it as it was but somehow what you saw was not the room but its emptiness. With a door you saw the opening. When he drew a pitchfork left learning against the barn wall you saw its abandonment.\" I grew to love this spellbinding book and highly recommend it to enthusiasts of literary historical fiction.

       "  'comment': 'It\\'s not really a tragedy if the protagonist\\'s hubris is so great that you want to see him fall. Still, this early Zelazny novel is full of rich, evocative passages. And his kabbalah is not entirely defective, either, when he brings out the qliphoth of Kether to preside over the psychotic break at the story\\'s climax.\\nThe chief science fiction concept of The Dream Master is \"neuroparticipant therapy,\" in which a doctor \"shapes\" the dreams of patients by entering into them with mechanical assistance, and providing subliminal cues through a \"ro-womb\" in which the patient sleeps. The protagonist Charles Render is a luminary in this still-nascent field. Zelazny illustrates Render\\'s high intelligence and education with a gratingly clever speech pattern, peppered with literary allusions.\\nIt was strange for me to have read this book so soon after the more recent Rant by Chuck Pahluniuk, since both involve meditations on the culture- and consciousness-transforming properties of the automobile, while neither book quite boasts that as its central theme. In The Dream Master, car traffic has become entirely autopiloted, and thus perfectly safe--to passengers. There is a connection of some sort being drawn between the car and the ro-womb. While material reality becomes safer and more reliable, psychic reality seems to be compensating with new hazards.\\nSeveral subplots end up somewhat unfulfilled, including one involving \"mutie\" dogs engineered for subhuman but supercanine intelligence, and another regarding Render\\'s son\\'s aspiration to a career in outer space. Still, for such a short novel, the wealth of ideas is impressive, as is the fact that many of the social and psychological conundrums chosen by the author forty years ago are ones that are still current in today\\'s science fiction.',\n",

He has selected ten lesser known and odd clauses of our Constitution and goes into a detailed examination of the wording, the probable reasoning behind the clause, and various cases challenging the validity, quoting court cases and lawyers alike. In most cases, he tries to understand the climate of the age in which the Constitution was written, and the historical context behind these clauses. Written with a wonderful sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek personal references, he is not afraid to voice his own opinions and beliefs, which is refreshing. I especially enjoyed the Notes, with the citations of the cases studied. Now that is bedtime reading at its best! All in all, a very good, informative and entertaining book. However, Im afraid the general public will not read it; I am amazed at the number of people in our country who do not know a thing about our government or our laws, and what is worse, do not care to learn about them. This book should be required reading in all high schools, along with teaching kids how to balance their checkbook. ',\n",

The whole feel of it is completely different than the first 5 books in that it consists mostly of memory flashbacks that help the reader unravel Voldemort's past and reminders of the war that is starting. Everything in the book is so dark and it gives you such an uneasy feeling while reading, even in the lighter moments of relationships, flirting, love, Quidditch games, and classes. The war and deaths are always near the surface so the reader can never relax. The final scenes with Harry finally taking control of his own life in helping to defeat Voldemort piece by piece and the Hogwarts battle are extremely intense and you'll find yourself holding your breath and exhaling only after you've finished the book. \",\n",

As a 20 year old in Iraq, vehemently opposed to Sadam Hussein, he was sent along with his father and brother to Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured. He never saw his brother again. He and his father escaped but his father left a broken man, so Ali was left with responsibilty for the family. It was then too dangerous for him in Iraq so his journey took him to Kurdistan, then Iran and Turkey. He applied to get the whole family to Australia as refugees but they were turned down. Ali left for Malaysia/ Indonesia with the aim of getting himself to Australia and then having the family follow him. His first try was a disaster for he paid money and was cheated. The people smuggler took the people who could pay the most and Ali and others were left sitting on the beach watching the boat leave. This left him with little money and no job. He felt that he could do a better job himself and he would treat desparate people fairly , and with decency and get them to Australia, and later his own family. The book goes into great detail, telling of his terrible time in Iraq, and his time as a people smuggler - the struggles he had to get the boats and the captains, and the number of people he worked with who let him down and cheated him. But over the years he did get several boat loads to Ashmore Reef and then to Australia, and many people are grateful to him. He managed to get almost all his family to Australia to before he was betrayed and caught in Thailand by the Australian police. Following that he spent time in a Darwin prison and in Villawood. It was recommended that he get a permanent visa but all he has been given is a bridging visa which means he can be sent back to Iraq at any time and cannot work or seek more education. He is seen by the Australian government as bad - he was a people smuggler and brought people to Australia illegally. I read this book just after seeing the SBS programme Go back to where you came from, from which I learnt a lot and this book filled in so much more detail. It is a heartbreaking story. I can see why he did what he did and I admire him for the way he helped desparate people with kindness and decency. He has lost the woman he loved, and later a wife and child and now lives a life in limbo. His case has been much in the news and on televison, and I feel I would like him to be able to live here freely and and work and hav a life. I know the asylum seeker issue is complicated but I do not see him as a bad man . ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'American Wife is the account of the life of the First Lady of the United States of America. Its fictional, but it is heavily based on the life of Laura Bush and her husband, George. In this sweeping novel Alice Blackwell traces her steps from her childhood in Wisconsin and a tragedy that has haunted her all of her life to the early stages of her relationship with Charlie Blackwell all the way to the White House. Throughout the book she does her best to fit in the Blackwell way of life; but a demure, small-town, liberal-minded woman has quite a tough time meshing her ideas with one of the Republican Partys powerhouse families.\\n\\tMost of Sittenfelds book flows very well; I drifted quickly through Alices childhood and early adulthood. Sometimes I wanted to strangle Alice  the choices she makes at times!  but shes a very realistic representation of an average woman raised to heights beyond her natural desires. Charlie Blackwell, her ambitious husband, is never satisfied with his wealth or position in society, so there is a constant tension between his desire to make a mark on the world and Alices own desires for the domestic tranquility of a normal family life. When the Blackwells arrive in the White House, however, the book seems to switch gears. Sittenfelds narrative becomes rather preachy and clearly critical of the Bush administration. Not that I dont agree with her on several points, but I felt she interrupted her storytelling flow and it was jarring. \\n\\tCharlie Blackwell, Bush surrogate, does come across as a crude-mouthed jerk in much of the book. But hes also affectionate toward his wife, genuine in his religious conversion, and almost pitiable as he reaches mid-life and realizes that hes done virtually nothing with his life. I thought his character was given fair treatment, but I suspect many would disagree.\\n\\tTheres quite a lot of hot, steamy sex sprinkled throughout the book. In some ways, it is disturbing, because I do not want to think about the Bushes that way. (Eew.) A lot of the sex did feel gratuitous and I didnt think it did much to move the story forward.\\n\\tI dont know very much about Laura Bush, so I really couldnt say the full extent of fact. vs. fiction in the story. American Wife definitely parallels her life in many ways, but its extremely important to remember that it is still a work of fiction. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. The relationship dynamics between Alice and Charlie and Alices struggle to reconcile her great love for her husband and her disagreement with many of his core policies make for an engrossing, beautiful story.

       "  'comment': \"This is a very simple, beautiful novel. It is written diary-style as letters to an old man's son. This man, a pastor, married quite late in life and had one son. He knows the end is near, and even though he has faith in heaven and the fact that he has lived a good life, he still bemoans the fact that he will not be around to watch his son grow up. Thus, he tries to tell him about experiences he has had and things he has loved and cared about. Robinson is able to portray really simple occurrences in a way that is just breathtaking (like a sunset or eating a particular meal). The father also goes into present events - the wayward son of his best friend (he is actually his godfather, and the boy is named after him) has come home, and his return dredges up many hard feelings for the protagonist. This boy, a very charming troublemaker, seduced a very young girl (never sure how young) and got her pregnant. He refused to claim the baby as his own, which broke his father's heart. His homecoming forces the protagonist to examine the ideas of forgiveness, charity, and self-examination. That is one thing I liked about this character - he was never afraid to examine his soul and his conscience to discover his true feelings and intentions. Parts of the book are a little dry, but overall, it is a peaceful, lovely read.\",\n",

So she makes herself a tray of breakfast and tries to sneak out the kitchen door, but the kids want to know where shes going. Mrs. Large says she just wants 5 minutes peace from them to take a bath. The kids decide their mom cant possibly want that much time away from them and one by one they invade the bathroom, reading stories, playing music, and bringing bath toys. Before she knows it, the kids have joined her splashing about in the tub. Mrs. Large gets out of the bath and manages to get 3 minutes and 45 seconds of peace in the kitchen before the kids come trooping down the stairs to find her.\\nThe illustrations are delightful, full of exasperated looks from Mrs. Large and messy abandon from the kids. I especially love the baby elephant, who spends quite a few pages with a cereal bowl on his head and is so excited he forgets to take his clothes off before jumping into the tub. The text is short and printed in a large font, making it easy for a child whos learning to read to follow along. \\nFull Review at Picture-Book-a-Day: http://picturebookaday.blogspot.com/2012/02/book-45-five-minutes-peace-by-jill.h...',\n",

All the questions are answered, but once again caution to the squimmish reader. Death, mutilation, torture, blood, guts, and gore are all presented in this book (and the whole series) with no reserve. Stephen King has a blurb on the cover for a reason. All that aside - I really enjoyed this series. The characters were real, even the badies! I would recommend to a boy (or girl) reader who likes horror or has read and enjoyed books about war and conflict. Read alikes to \"I Am Number Four\" and \"Lord of the Flies\". ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Like Daniel Silva (whose thriller, The Secret Servant, I last reviewed), Olen Steinhauer writes an espionage series with a recurring character. Unlike Silva, Steinhauer doesnt weigh his down with clunky exposition explaining what happened in previous novels. Albeit, The Nearest Exit is the second in Steinhauers Milo Weaver series, as opposed to six previous novels in Silvas Gabriel Allon series.\\nSome similarities are that both writers show espionage as a dirty, ugly business with no moral center and too much killing. Beyond that they dont seem to have much in common. Weaver has the kind of real family problems that anyone who is away too much for work can relate to. He also has issues with secrecy, paranoia and trust that few people do. He tries to quit his job, but cant seem to get away. Hes a real person dealing with unusual problems  not a superhero.\\nThe espionage aspect of Steinhauers books also seems more realistic than many others, especially in the way technology affects everyday life, from cell phone capabilities to ubiquitous security cameras in public spaces. \\nOverall, The Nearest Exit is a satisfying, multilayered story, an excellent continuation of the series as well as one of the better espionage novels Ive read.

We all know that our nation (this goes for all nations, not just the US) never, never, never does anything wrong. Our country\\'s newspapers chronicle the munificence, benevolence and philanthropy of our nation every single day. Our nation never does anything wrong, it\\'s only the other nations of the world that do bad and wrong things.\\nHistory as a subject in school is merely a retelling of the events that play out in the newspapers every day in your country. Standard history textbooks are nothing more than a collection of those front pages from the most mainstream, establishment-oriented newspapers in your country which is why for me history was the one subject in school I could never understand the need to study.\\nStudying history in school is so boring. It was always guaranteed (for me) to be one subject that put me to sleep in class. The history textbooks went something like this, \"Our country is great. We fought a battle over here and over there and defeated the enemy in order to secure the safety of our citizens. We are good. We never do bad things. The world is a better place with us as a country in it. Patriotism is next to godliness and to question loyalty to the flag is what criminals (who do drugs) do. People in other countries are not as good as we are. We are the best and we always win (good always triumphs over evil). Our expansion was a necessity and was borne out of a need to secure our borders and make our citizens safe. We are a country of common people. We are you. You make up our country. Thank you for creating our country. Without you, we would not be a country.\" That what I remember about learning history in school. What a lie. What a fucking lie. Yawn.\\nHoward Zinn\\'s book is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING like history textbooks they used when I went to school.\\nHistory, as taught in school (in every? country of the world) is an imperialist\\'s chronology of events that created and shaped that particular country. That version of history, as taught in textbooks, is a lie. History textbooks are nothing more than the beginning of a person\\'s indoctrination into a particular country\\'s citizenry. There is no class where a nation can shape the views of its citizens more than history, and as a subject preparing you for life, it\\'s the most useless subject a school system can teach a student, but you\\'ll find it\\'s one of the most critical subjects as defined by a country\\'s school curriculum developers. Nothing learned in history is useful in every day life less than what you learned in history. Although it may be of great interest to some people, history holds no real value in the every day world like, for example, maths or reading or grammar or science or foreign languages.\\nRead this book and take one thing away from it: our countries lie to us every day and this book documents many, many of those lies which were taught to us in school and which our children are learning today. We were lied to. Our government lied to us. Governments lie to us. Governments lie. Stop believing what your government tells you, because it\\'s all a lie. Buy this book, read it, learn from it, and make sure you correct the lies your children are learning in school. It\\'ll make them better citizens tomorrow and your country will be a better country for it. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"It has taken something like a month, but Ulysses is finally done. I have conquered one of the Literary Behemoths (with Moby Dick and Middlemarch often considered as the other 2 of the Great Big Scary 3).\\nMany aspects of this book are very, very challenging, and in my opinion you may want a little exposure to Joyce (like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) before you attempt this book. The other thing I strongly suggest is the new book Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd. Kiberd is essentially THE Joycean and spells out important literary concepts for each chapter of Ulysses.\\nThere are so many things the book brings up, but my personal favorite discussion has been the balance between art and obscenity within the eyes of the law.\\nI remember touring NYU when I was between junior and senior year of high school. Right there, in the middle of the Art Department main office, was a black and white photograph of a woman sitting on the toilet. I was shocked. She had a faraway look in her eyes, and she was clearly thinking about something else-- the grocery list, all the things she had to do, something overwhelming. I was... confused but mentally intrigued. I had never seen anyone on the toilet before, and it's not something I actively think about other people doing. Ulysses is a lot like that. Almost as soon as Leopold Bloom, the main character, is introduced, we see him on the toilet. It's not particularly gross or graphic, but it's a private moment and there the reader is-- hovering. The book spans the course of one day, June 16th, and we see Leopold do pretty much everything. He eats, farts, has lustful thoughts... sure, some of the lustful thoughts might be creepy out of context, but in the 700 pages of context given, the reader becomes aware that this persistent lust is mostly due to the fact that he and his wife don't get down to the hanky-panky very much since their infant son died ten years ago.\\nJoyce shows every aspect of life in such away that the reader realizes exactly what it it to be a human, full of conflict, obsessive thoughts and bodily needs (that goes back to the eating and farting). Just be prepared, because you have to find that beauty among a load of experimental styles and prose that can get very heavy at times. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I fell in love with Thrity Umrigar's The Space Between Us when I read it several years ago and was quite excited to see that a new book of hers was being released. This is a very different story than that one was though, a look at Indian/American relations on both a global and a personal level.\\nFrank and Ellie, two Americans from Michigan, have moved to rural India after the unexpected and breathtaking loss of their seven year old son Benny. They hope that with Frank's acceptance of the head position at a progressive, liberal-minded multinational company's factory in Girbaug, India they will start to heal themselves, face their grief, and save their suffering marriage. What happens, in fact, could never have been predicted. Over the two years since Benny died, Frank becomes deeply emotionally attached to Ramesh, the young son of his and Ellie's housekeeper and cook. Ramesh is a smart child who faces no future in the small village, both because of the lack of opportunity and because his parents are a mixed marriage, Hindu and Christian, and therefore not accepted by the community. Ramesh thrives under Frank's interest and tutelage while Ellie is made terribly uncomfortable by Frank's growing obession with the boy she sees as usurping the space Benny would have occupied had he lived. Aside from Ramesh, Frank does not much like India, tolerating it as best he can. Ellie, on the other hand, is thriving in this totally foreign culture, helping out in the village by teaching and counseling the women. Her humanitarian impulses remain unchecked while Frank turns more cynical, exposed as he is to the underbelly of the business world.\\nUmrigar not only develops the personal angle in this story but she also focuses in on the impact of business and globalization on both the haves and the havenots. The workers at the factory are not only being paid barely subsistence wages, but the villagers are also angry that HerbalSolutions is treating the girbal trees they have come to see as their birthright as private property all because the corrupt and distant national Indian government has leased the trees to the company. When a worker, the local union man, dies after police roughing him up, things get tense. And there's no easy answer here given the general good character and responsibility of the company set against a way of life they didn't know they were disrupting. Neither the company nor the villagers are entirely in the right but there is certainly a fairly pervading sense of American might making right, even amongst the most liberal when their backs are against the wall.\\nUmrigar ratchets up the tension throughout the novel so that the reader knows a big explosion is coming and that nothing good can come of it. But she manages to use Frank's increasing instability to bring the novel to a shocking conclusion, one that offers no easy answers for those who live and work in the global world. Right and wrong, intrinsic morality and gross disappointment thread through both narrative arcs here. Ellie and Frank's grief for their lost son is palpable and the growing menace of life in Girbaug seems to take on a life of its own so that the reader is compelled to turn the pages faster and faster wanting to escape the desperate sadness and yet needing to slow down and keep the ending at bay for a little longer. Frank and Ellie are a bit black and white as characters but Edna and Prakash make up for that, being more multi-faceted. The business situation with all its complications, stresses, looming troubles, and cultural misunderstandings rings quite true. Umrigar has written a book that will linger in the reader's mind for a long time. Those who are as fascinated by South Asian literature as I am will definitely want to pick this one up. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"On a small dairy farm in Cork County, Ireland, young pregnant vegetarians sing songs from The Sound of Music while they milk the cows. Two old men, Corrie and Fee, make the cheese, and Avis, a widow, runs the house. The farm at Coolarney is a magical place where the lonely and troubled can find help and peace.\\nMeanwhile, New York stockbroker Kit Stephens finds himself on an alcoholic downward spiral after the loss of his wife. And on a small Pacific island, Abby Corrigan, estranged granddaughter of Corrie, discovers that her husband has been cheating on her with numerous local women. Where can Kit and Abby find solace? It is no surprise they both end up on the dairy farm in Ireland.\\nI came across Blessed Are the Cheesemakers when browsing my library's OverDrive selections. I liked the title and cover and was amused by the idea of singing pregnant vegetarian milkmaids. Although the major story line is mostly predictable and sometimes improbable, Lynch manages to throw in a few twists before the end. The charm, kindness, and friendship of Corrie and Fee won me over, and I wanted to see where their lives were going. I was less taken with Kit and Abby, finding it difficult to understand their life choices.\\nThis isn't literary fiction, but if you're looking for something to read on a rainy day or while sitting on the beach, you might want to try this light novel. However, I suggest that you read the print book rather than listen to the audiobook. Narrator Heather O'Neill did a fine job with the Irish characters, but her New York, Australian, and Pacific Islander accents were almost painful to hear.\\nhttp://bfishreads.blogspot.com/2008/12/review-blessed-are-cheesemakers-by.html \",\n",

I certainly felt somewhat more enlightened after reading it, particularly in regards to the media\\'s oversensationalization of reporting safety \"hazards\" and government overregulation. Minus points for typos (seriously, should have been fixed by the paperback printing), and minus one star for his overgeneralized hatred of unions. Also, I have concerns about his love of contracting out government services to for-profit corporations. He only presents the evidence that supports his viewpoint here and fails to mention episodes like the Accenture voting system debacle currently going on in Wisconsin. However, no matter what your take on his opinions, it makes a good conversation starter, but a more balanced view would have been better. ',\n",

I liked it, but there were a few aspects of the story that just felt...off. First, Callie's refusal to tell anyone about her condition got really old really quickly. On the one hand I kind of understood her rationale, but it just felt as if she were making everything a hundred times harder than it had to be by refusing to let anyone in on her problems. It felt like it went against the type of person she was. Secondly, it bothered me that after a few initial mentions of Callie's calling as a photographer (the scene where Levi finds her in the barn totally psyched about finding and photographing an ant hill was really cute) it felt like it was just dropped. I suppose it could be explained away by saying she was sick and therefore had other priorities, but really, it felt odd and again, out of character. Finally, though I know it's a romance and therefore going to have a happy ending, it ended up feeling ultimately too easy, lacking the realistic and dramatic punch that it could have had.\\nThat said, though, I really did like the relationship and romance between Callie and Levi. It was definitely a highlight of the book--as it should be--and well done. I am looking forward to seeing what is in store next for this group of friends.\\n \",\n",

As always, his descriptions of police procedure and witness protection are very realistic. Police corruption forms a major part of the story: I do hope theres at least a few cops left in NSW who arent.

       "  'comment': 'I loved the creativity of all the characters, but especially Akilah and her \"girl warrior\" attitude! She reminds me of one of my students. I also truly enjoyed how up-to-date the book was with surfing on the Internet, having an international student population, instant messaging, etc. It provided a realistic contrast to what many believe is not modern  female genital mutilation. Williams-Garcia approaches this topic with honesty, but in a delicate way. I also really liked Ms. Saunders, the teacher, who encourages Akilah to be the person she knows she is. The teacher\\'s faith in Akilah shows the positive influence that teachers can have, especially when they truly know their students. Another topic that is broached is friendship and I think the author\\'s idea of a difference between a \"best friend\" and a \"true friend\" is important for girls in this age group. The book says it is intended for grades 7 and up and I assume that is more for the content than the readability. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Synopsis: Night Embrace is the 2nd novel in Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunters series. Also set in New Orleans, this book tells the story of Talon, an ancient Celt turned Dark-Hunter whom we met in Night Pleasures. Our hero meets Sunshine, a kooky artist-type one night when she is attacked by a bunch of soul-sucking Daimons. In the midst of the fight, he gets plowed by a runaway Mardi Gras float and Sunshine takes him back to her place to recover. Their one-night stand turns into something more as a couple of ancient gods with an ax to grind show up to come after Talon and his new girlfriend. We also get to meet some other Dark-Hunters in this one, including Zarek, who gets his own story in Dance With the Devil.\\nI didn't like Night Embrace quite as much as I liked Night Pleasures, but you get a lot of good character development with Zarek and Ash. You also get introduced to Wulf, another Dark-Hunter whose story is told in Kiss of the Night. And the action sequences in this one are supercool. The romance just wasn't as heart-rending as the other books in the series, but the plot is so interesting and the interplay between the Dark-Hunters and Ash and the Squires makes this novel an important part of the series as a whole. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Urban fantasy is always a hit and miss for me, since not always the author manages to be romantic when all around the heroes the world is crashing down. But T.A. Chase always preserves the romanticism, historical, contemporary, futuristic, fantasy, doesnt matter, the story is always about two men in love, about one big, strong and of few words hero and his little, cute and feisty lover. \\nIn this case the big man is James, ordinary name for a not so ordinary man: he is a Freaks, a genetically mutant man, a mix between a human and snake; he is the result of a era of nuclear war and consequent radiations, and like others like him, he was confined to live behind a wall, in a place that is both reserve than prison. Not that on the other side of the wall the situation is better: gangs govern the city, and having a quiet life and becoming old is a fortunate chance. Magpie has the right name for his character, he is little, fast and obnoxious. He is not a thief, but truth be told, he is not even a good bodyguard, or so it seems. While James works for one of the mob bosses, Magpie works for his at time ally at time enemy. Magpie and James know each other, and maybe they have also fantasized about each other, but the situation they are living doesnt invite romantic relationships. Then one day they are both involved in an attack, Magpie is mortally wounded and James is the only one who can save his life. James doesnt think twice, and actually doesnt even ask Magpies opinion, he literally drags the man out of the deadly place and takes him in Freak Town, the place James left years ago swearing he would never come back, but also the only place where they can find shelter. \\nMagpie complaints a lot, but I have the feeling that is more a role he has to play, than a real upsetting situation. Deep inside Magpie is happy to have the chance to be with James, and while with words he is saying that he hates the man and doesnt want to have anything to do with him, with his body he is like a climbing ivy, more than happy to conquer the mountain man and set his roots deep around him. \\nThere is also sex, not as much as in other gay romance, but quite enough to be enjoyable and to balance the dark mood of the setting. In the end, the novel is more light than expected, and even when in danger, the bickering between Magpie and James, or better between Magpie and an unmovable James who hardly opens his mouth to speak, gives an almost funny undertone. \\nhttp://elisa-rolle.livejournal.com/1002316.html',\n",

As with all wordless books, children can apply their own interpretation to the pictures to create a story that is uniquely theirs.

But each one is approached from the standpoint of a detective. For example, Goldilocks is referred to as the blonde, and she tells Detective Joe Humpty she is house-sitting at the three bears cottage. The bright, colorful illustrations are fun to look at, and full of detail. There is at least one cute running gag. At the end of the book, reference is made to the lost sheep of Little Bo Peep. On a second read-through, I discovered that sheep are hidden in various illustrations throughout the book. It is really clever that the illustrations not only support the text, but reveal more information each time they are studied. The engaging pictures and fun to read text would make this story an excellent choice for a third to fifth grade classroom library. It would also make a fun read aloud (using a classic detective voice, of course).',\n",

       "  'comment': 'There\\'s a long running joke that any book can be summed up in one sentence. The example that seems to get the most laughs is a college professor summing up The Illiad as \"guy comes home from work.\" It\\'s glib and cute, but the point is that the essence of most books will fit into a single sentence. \\nLate Wife would go something like: woman divorces, splits, remarries, feels awkward. When it was first described to me it sounded like it was going to be melodramatic and angsty. The subject matter itself could easily pull most well written books into a category where the narrator\\'s plights seem laughable-- like their too much. The reason this book is getting so much attention is because Claudia Emerson never loses her audience. The poems are incredibly mature without being stolid. They\\'re lyrical without being meaningless. This book is perfectly balanced, and the product is beautiful. \\nThe divorce epistles work together to form a great series of poems, as well as standing alone. In a volume of poetry it\\'s incredibly difficult to provide a convincing narrative. The poet takes on the task of the poet and the novel writer, only that the novel writer has the luxury of pacing. Each poem in a book like this needs to stand alone-- the same can\\'t be said for a novel. Late Wife does it, and it does it well. \\nThe hype over this book is well deserved. Late Wife manages to be so many things at once-- even handed, detached, sensitive, nostalgic, bitter, narrative, lyrical, and it tells a story. Late Wife is everything a collection of poetry should be. Late Wife has set the bar, hopefully other poets will follow Emerson\\'s example and produce collections with enough thought behind them to tell a story, to move an audience regardless of the reader\\'s own background, to use their collections for something outside of showcasing a couple of great poems buffered by a bunch of mediocre ones.

In a way, this is a bit disappointing because I was left feeling like I didnt really get it in some places. Here I am, trying to learn more about what it was like for Clune to be addicted to heroin, but Im left feeling kind of lost. At the same time, I feel like that was maybe the point, because Clune was feeling a bit lost himself. I just had to keep telling myself, Heather, youve never been addicted to heroin. Just keep reading, let it wash over you, and keep it moving. Once I started to just read and stopped trying to analyze, the feeling of Clunes addiction started to come through and I think I understood it a little better.\\nEven though White Out left me feeling that I didnt quite get it in a way, I gave the book a four-star rating because I like the way Clune writes, and I have a lot of respect for him for telling his story in the first place. I think writing this book was a very brave thing to do, and I think that it has the potential to help peopleboth addicts and those close to themwho are going through the same things. I would recommend White Out to anyone who enjoys reading memoirs and/or anyone who is interested in learning more about what it is like to be addicted to heroin.\\nRead my full review on Between the Covers...

       "  'comment': \"Full disclosure here; I do judge books by their covers and quite often by their titles. I miss out on a lot of great reads this way, but the way I look at it is that there are more great reads in existence than I have existence left for anyway, so no great loss there. I've never read, for instance, [The Corrections] because it puts me in mind of pop quizzes and I won't read [Freedom] because of a George Michael video with spoiled super models and I have never read the [The Book Thief], until now, because I had plenty of those in my life already. Every friend, acquaintance and family member who 'borrowed' a book, in fact. Luckily I had some down time away from home and nothing with me but a kindle so I bought it because it was cheap (five bucks and well worth every penny) and I was bored.\\nThe book does have a lot of book thievery. It begins with a little girl stealing a book about burying the dead and ends with Death stealing a book about the life of little girl. I could kick myself for not reading it sooner. This book is allegedly for a young-adult audience but it reads more like literary fiction that high schoolers could enjoy as well. \\nZusak grabs the reader's attention immediately with his choice of narrator, Death, and he keeps it by making him very charming and really kind of funny. In Death's words this is a book about, among other things: a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist fighter and quite a lot of thievery. A simple story about what makes us human.\\nThe girl is Liesel Meminger, an orphan whose greatest joys and greatest sorrows in life come from words. The words used to label her father a communist, the rhetoric of Hitler, the words she flings like knives to wound someone who has hurt her and the words in the books she steals that help her cope with the horrors of Nazi Germany. Her foster father, the accordionist, teaches her to read using her first stolen book, The Grave Digger' Handbook, at the age of ten and from then on she's unstoppable. Whenever she's under stress she copes by stealing a book. While stealing gives her a sense of control over her life her true love is language and literature. \\n There is so much to love about this book.\\nEvery character in the novel is so believable that you would recognize them instantly if they ever walked down your street. Papa, Hans Huberman, a decent man who keeps his promises regardless of the cost to himself, The great-hearted, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed Rosa Huberman, Max Vandenburg, the hidden Jew who gave Liesel two of her most precious books and most of all Liesel's best friend Rudy Steiner, a vivid, funny, life-loving boy who breaks Death's heart. Even the secondary characters are finely drawn.\\nAnd then there is the irresistible prose. In Death's diary he notes of the aftermath of the bombing of Cologne: 'Five hundred souls. I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms.' And when Liesel finally kisses Rudy, who'd been in love with her for years: 'Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees...'\\nNot least of all, of course, is the story itself, of the beauty of ordinary lives in extraordinary times. The love, kindness and loyalty that enables people to to maintain their humanity in the face of brutality, and makes them immortal. People remembered by fondly by Death himself. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Wow! What a title. Yes, here are a group of program ideas for teens, mostly for the public library but also for schools serving teens where you want to get some activities that attract going. Here is how I would suggest you use this book. Cut it up into the various chapters and pass the chapters around to a teen advisory group during a planning meeting. It is good for an idea starter, albeit an expensive one, in order to stimulate ideas for library programs that would attract a crowd. Yes, there is a poetry slam here, and performance programs by the teens themselves in a kindlier venue than American Idol will be appropriate, particularly if you can archive some of this stuff. Yes, the teen school library/learning commons plus the virtual learning commons needs to be a place of performance, fun, and involvement. I cant forget the school board member I met in a high school library one time who refused to come to the fourth annual poetry slam the next day where students would read their own poetry. She said, I refuse to be in tears for a whole day for the fourth time as the kids bare their souls! Perhaps the school learning commons should gain such a reputation. Perhaps it doesnt have to be just a place to escape from a class or the place to neck in the stacks, orabout anything else disruptive one can think about. The accompanying CD has lots of posters, forms and brochures that duplicate the ideas in the book. Your students can create better ones than these, but they give the idea. So, here is one idea source with some traditional and some unique ideas. Just get started.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"It's intimidating enough to read Moby Dick... it's almost as intimidating to try to write anything interesting about it. Although writing about it might not be so bad if reading it is any indication: I found myself pulled into the first 200 pages or so; I was pleased to be met with accessible characters, lofty but humorous language, and a laid back plotlessness (they don't get on the ship until a quarter of the way into the book!). It almost read like a children's book with very archaic words and complex sentence structures. So this tome was really much more pleasant to wade into than its reputation would suggest. It's not until I got into the thick of the whaling specifics that I started to understand where that reputation came from.\\nAs for the whaling parts: I found them fascinating too, for the most part: but fascinating in a different way. I have a theory that the whaling parts are used as a simulation of real-time passing. So you're drifting along in the sea and nothing happens for weeks at a time. That's sort of what reading this book is like. While Ishmael is giving you a (always very subjective) lesson on the different types of whale blubber, you're drifting out in the open sea, and nothing much of note is happening. Every once in a while something small happens, or you cross paths with another ship, and it feels like a relief.\\nAnd some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.\\nMy second theory, as the above quote suggests, is that whaling here is used as a metaphor for EVERYTHING. This isn't much of a theory, as any dumb dumb would notice it, more like an obvious observation. When Ishmael talks about anything whaling related, he uses flowery and biblical language, obviously tying the current subject (whaling) to many other levels of life. He makes comparison over comparison, in an excess of like-nesses. But for the reader, it doesn't have to stop there. The in-depth-ness and passion of his study makes the subject matter applicable to a wide range of interpretations. At one point Ishmael says,\\nTo produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.\\nBut I disagree. I think if someone were to truly put their minds into the investigation of flea minutiae, if it had as impassioned an ambassador, it too can become a metaphor for many things, and be interpreted as a comment on modern life. I'm convinced the magic doesn't come from within the whale, but within Ishmael himself, inside of his obsessive compulsive mind where the white whale rolls its wide bulk.\\nIshmael, not being a very experienced whaler, quite ridiculously overcompensates in his effulgent praise of whaling, where whaling holds a disproportionately noble, sacred place above all other trivial ways of eking out an existence. It is inside of Ishmael's obsession that Ahab's own obsession of Moby Dick comes to life. Thus, which is the greater? I read this as part of a online group read (Infinite Summer style), and one of the more enlightening posts was on this very subject of Ishmael's subjectivity.\\nAnd Ishmael isn't content with just narrating what he knows, he narrates as if he were omniscient. Parts of the book are like a play where each character has his Shakespearean monologue. Often Ishmael tells you exactly what they are thinking too, down to very personal details that he probably just imagined for the purpose of creating more drama in his story. It's hilarious, and the whole chapter-written-as-one-act-play thing really amused me because it felt like Melville was throwing the kitchen sink into telling this story. Or rather, creating many entrances into building up the story yourself.\\nOne thing I found a little disappointing was that a lot of the other characters, even ones that you'd think would have a bigger role like Queequeg, don't get much development, and often 20 chapters would go by without one mention of him. It felt a little lonely sometimes, all alone inside Ishmael's head without the company of the others.\\nAhab's fate, much foreshadowed, finally comes to a conclusion in the last 50 pages or so, in exciting chapter after exciting chapter. But not until, Ahab shows a very human, less intimidating side of himself when he recalls his childhood. Alas, like a special features DVD, this review comes with an alternate ending. I hope you enjoy. \",\n",

Plague is scheduled for release in April of 2011. Nothing is ever easy in the FAYZ. The residents barely survive one threat before facing another one. In this latest installment, people thought dead now walk the streets, the non-freaks (Grants terminology, not mine) are beginning to resent the Freaks (those with strange powers), and what little semblance of order there was from the establishment of the Town Council quickly evaporates. Zil, leader of the Human Crew sets fire to the town in an attempt to take power away from the mutants (freaks). Osray, now labeled the Prophetess by her strange new companion Nerezza, seems to be telling the children they should embrace the poof or maybe even death as a way to escape the FAYZ. As tempers flare, people go hungry and the evil darkness threatens to return (if it ever really left), Sam, Astrid, Edilio and the others must find a way to survive. And even if they survive what will they be facing next?\\nI cant wait for the next installment. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'I love that whoosh of freshness that comes from moving from one book to the next. Books are so different to each other, the experience is often like stepping into a cold shower. This modern novel could hardly be more different from Henry James - stripped down, accessible text. So, does that mean that complexity is lost too. Well, yes, it does a little. Henry James is a more accomplished and vastly more ambitious writer. That is not to say that Mohsin Hamid is a facile writer. He does not want to layer this book down complexity. The text should read as clear as it can.\\nThe book consists of extended monologue - one side of a conversation that takes place over a whole evening in a cafe in Lahore. An American tourist has been buttonholed by an English speaking local with a story to tell.\\n \\nIn being critical of American foreign policy the book is likely to be more controversial in the States than here in Britain and critics will undoubtedly focus on the protagonists smile when he hears of the attack on the World Trade Centre. But it wold be a mistake to reject the book as merely an anti-American polemic. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Whatever special sauce has been getting so many people excited about this series...I don't get it.\\n(1) Secret McQueen is a badass? Um...kinda. I mean, if you like badass characters who take insane risks for dumb reasons, don't prepare for big showdowns, get themselves into trouble and need to be rescued. Secret only really wins one fight in this book - the first one, with the newbie vampire. All the others are, at best, draws. I was not impressed.\\n(2) The worldbuilding? Well, that was ok. Not particularly fresh or new, with some annoying inconsistencies - sometimes Secret knows nothing about werewolves, sometimes she knows the ropes of the were world - but could have been fun.\\n(3) Secret's horde of love interests? Secret has so many boyfriends it's no wonder that the author can't do any single relationship well. Her books just don't contain enough words to develop bonds with THAT many guys. One early, irritating example: Secret gets a cinnamon vibe from a strange guy. He kidnaps her, takes her up to his penthouse lair, unbuttons his shirt, sits her down and informs her that he's a billionaire werewolf king and they're soul-bonded. Secret leaves and angsts about whether or not she wants a soul-bond. This whole encounter just made me sigh. It's a particularly boring example of insta-love, which is never my favorite. Not interesting. Not new. Not sexy. And I felt the same way about the other...what? Three or four guys she's got circling around her?\\n(4) The writing? Yeah, no. It's awful. Lots of infodumping. Lots of telling instead of showing. Flat, dull, annoying. \",\n",

Normally, I find Harlequin romances formulaic in format and rather predictable. This book was a bit better than most, maybe because this is the second book that I have read by RaeAnne Thayne.\\nI found the situation that put a Hollywood socialite at the mercy of a random cowboy / army major to be a little unbelievable, but once the plot moved past the initial stages, I liked the chemistry between Mimi Van Hoyt and Brant Western. The two characters were in many ways complete opposites, but they still complemented each other. It was hugely ironic that Mimi became homemaker to Brant's place -- nesting syndrome was kicking in early. I also did not expect the period of separation, though it fit with Brant's military duties.\\nThis book was a sweet, quick read that made me smile. \",\n",

Ivo was vital in a recent victory and the king wishes to reward him. Without fully thinking of the consequences Ivo asks for land as payment. What he receives is more than he bargains for. \\nLady Alaida spends her days fending off suitors and watching over the lands of Alnwick that were seized when her grandfather was imprisoned. As she soon learns, the king has not only given rule of Alnwick to Ivo but he has also ordered them to marry in order to seal his hold on the lands. With beautiful looks and a sharp tongue Alaida quickly steals the heart of Ivo and after a quick wedding Ivo awakens in Alaida a passion she never knew existed. \\nBut Ivo has a secret that no one but two of his trusted men share. Long ago Ivo was cursed with immortality that has him spending his days in the form of an eagle. Each morning before dawn Ivo leaves Alaida and increasingly she begs to know the truth behind his mysterious hunting trips. However within days a vision warns that a child born to the couple also has the shape-shifting curse and Ivo makes the decision to keep his distance from Alaidas bed to spare her from the horror of this vision coming true. \\nWill this combination tear them apart or will their love set them free???\\nImmortal Warrior is a combination of a historical and a paranormal romance. I admit I was a bit hesitant when I noticed the historical aspects of the book but I was immediately pulled into the story. The writing is incredible and the characters jump to life within the pages. You get two great storylines in one awesome book: a great romance with steamy sex between Ivo and Alaida plus the background story for the Immortal Brotherhood series. \\nI cant wait to read the next book series, Immortal Outlaw, and I recommend this book to all historical, paranormal and romantic suspense lovers.

Of course, it didn't hurt that it's set in a slightly magical version of Renaissance Venice (which I love), with Nostradamus (no, not that one - his nephew, though, and the prophecies are no less obscure) as a supporting character. I'm not a particular fan of mysteries, so the whodunit nature of the plot is not an additional draw, but it's certainly not a detraction, either. (As an aside, however, this is an supporting data point for the thesis which states that speculative fiction is a supergenre rather than a genre proper, and can in fact be a perfect example of any genre it so chooses.)\\nIn short, it's good, it's fun, it's (fairly) short. Also, the entire trilogy is out, so you needn't worry about Waiting For The Next Book Syndrome. (I know everyone calls that George R. R. Martin syndrome these days, and with fairly obvious reason. But I tend to feel like the poor guy has enough people ragging on him without becoming a household word for overdue series installments, and so while I may well adopt the term after his next book comes out, as a matter of principle I refrain for now.)\\n( http://weblog.siliconcerebrate.com/zenos-library/2009/06/the_alchemists_apprenti... ) \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I enjoy memoirs, so I wanted to like this book. The title was intriguing. Hooligan makes me think of the McCourt lads, and some boys I knew in my childhood--the ones our parents used as Bad Examples, because they were always in some kind of minor trouble that pre-disposed them to entanglement in the bigger and more dangerous kinds. A Mormon Boyhood suggested I would learn things about growing up Mormon in Utah that would be different from growing up Methodist in Pennsylvania. Not only did the book fail to live up to its title, it failed almost completely as a memoir. Yes, it is full of recollections, in general terms, of boyhood in Provo, Utah, in the years just before World War II. But most of these recollections, far from being in any sense personal, enlightening or unique, could have come from the memory of my brother, whose boyhood was spent at the other end of the country, 3 decades later.\\n\\tHooligan is not a story, in a narrative sense, and it lacks a main character. This memoirs biggest failing, for me, is the total absence of the author as a person. I didnt know who Douglas Thayer was when I began reading, and I still had no idea who he was when I finished. I did know there was very little of the \"hooligan about him. Life events that must have been critical to the boy Doug, and that could have been moving or revealing to the reader are treated as asides; his parents divorce, his fathers death, the accidental shooting death of another boy, the coming of the war are mentioned, but in a detached and general manner that gives us no insight into their formative effect on the author.\\nFor a teacher of creative writing, Thayer has a peculiarly spirit-less style. His childhood is often reduced to laundry lists of activities, foods, and common mothering expressions without particular context. (Youll put your eye out, was funny in A Christmas Story. Here, its just another clich in a basketful.)\\n\\tOnly in rare passages does the child of this narrative come alive, and these few instances are remarkable. Thayers description of riding his bicycle out of town to go fishing alone (in Chapter 10) made me catch my breath and wonder if I just hadnt been paying attention up to that point. Most of the book is written in the first person plural, as if the author were part of a collective, or in the second person, which distances him even further from his own life. When Thayer lapses (and it does feel like inadvertence) into using I, there is a suggestion of potential brilliance in his writing, and I got the feeling he might be capable of conveying so much more. But in a little under 200 pages, I marked less than half a dozen paragraphs for their lasting impact. Heres one of them: All summer in our trips down to the fields wed watched for pheasants, especially after the hay and grain were cut and you could see the flocks along the edges of the fields in the early evening, maybe twelve or fifteen hens and three or four roosters. If the setting sun was just right and the rooster turned, his whole breast shone like fire. Riding our bikes down the lanes, we heard the rooster cackling, the sound sharp, sudden and thrilling. If only hed given us more of that and less of this: Pick-and-shovel work was considered the least skilled and hardest of manual labors, and you were warned that it was what you would end up doing for the rest of your natural life if you didnt get a good job, the rest of your natural life being somehow longer and worse than just your life. Working on the railroad as a section hand laying track was also considered quite limitedYou were constantly told you needed to amount to something, but you were never told what \\n\\tWhen I read, I sometimes hear a voice in my head speaking the words. In this book, it was Andy Rooneys voice I heard. I realized that the style of Thayers memoir reminded me of Mr. Rooneys style in the short pieces he does at the end of 60 Minutes, where it works quite well. Over the course of full-length book, it wears very thin. \\n\\tA blurb on the back cover of Hooligan asserts that Mr. Thayer is known in some circles as a Mormon Hemingway. Another touts him as One of the finest writers the LDS Church has yet produced. I dont much like Hemingway, but I dont see the parallels, either. I cant dispute the latter claim, because I dont know of any other writers produced by the LDS church. In a genre that includes works by Annie Dillard, Bobbie Ann Mason, Rick Bragg, Russell Baker, Robert MacNeil, Pete Hamill, Joan Didion, Elie Wiesel (I, too, can make lists), Hooligan falls far from the standard of excellence. Read An American Childhood or A Drinking Life. Youll learn something, youll feel something. Youll wish you could meet the author. Thats what reading a memoir should do for you. ',\n",

But I picked it back up and immediately fell in love with it. I'm a huge fan of Priest's work and Boneshaker totally didn't disappoint. I wasn't sure what to make of the characters at first, but as soon as they returned behind the wall, I knew. The characters and plot are strong, and I really loved the relationship between mother and son. The steampunk elements are exquisitely woven throughout the 1800s setting of Seattle. I liked the addition of zombies (it took me a moment to realize that's what Priest meant, which was amusing) and I thought the story had a strong, fast pace that made it fun.

       "  'comment': 'Even though one-third or as much as one-half of the population is introverted, the culture celebrates extroverts and therefore leaves a sizable group of children and adults questioning their likes and dislikes, says the author. But those who tend to be quiet and thoughtful might be surprised to learn that much of the world has been shaped by introverts. Further, introverts are told that they can learn to be confident in their nature and to capitalize on their reserve and self-reliant tendencies. If youre a student and dont like group work, or even if you do, this book will be an interesting eye-opener about why that is. Anyone hoping to better understand themselves or the complexities of classroom or workplace personalities will likely enjoy this excellent book. ',\n",

It is a study of the major riots of 2001 in Bradford, which became infamous in part because of the severe penalties meted out to the so-called rioters (unprecedentedly long sentences were handed out). This book gives a detailed inside story. From my point of view, as a theorist of policing of public disorder, its a very provocative book. Several of us over the years have been putting together a general theory of what we think is a good overall explanation of the policing of public disorder. Paul Bagguley and Yasmin Hussain reject this theory, saying that patterns in protests dont exist  an assertion I refute entirely! I do nonetheless recommend that people read the book to look at the principles of effective policing nominated by the authors and see how they might relate to what the police did well or badly in relation to the Bradford riots....\" (reviewed by David Waddington in FiveBooks).\\n\\nThe full interview is available here: http://fivebooks.com/interviews/david-waddington-on-policing-public-disorder ',\n",

Tom (Scott Speedman of TV's Felicity) approaches Dan (James Marsden of X-Men) in a bar, and the two hit it off. Tom brings Dan home to his apartment, where, after some idle chatter, Dan tries to kiss Tom. Tom shies away, and begins asking Dan about his sexual history. Dan eventually realizes that he's been in Tom's apartment before. They had an encounter several years ago, and Tom has a much clearer memory of that night than Dan does. Eventually, things turn ugly, and Dan finds himself tied to a chair. Tom extracts a blood sample, explaining to Dan that he just recently learned that he's HIV-positive. Tom insists that he's not gay, and believes that the only way he could have gotten the virus is from Dan. Tom goes out to have the blood sample tested, and when he gets back, he tells Dan that when he gets the results back, if Dan is HIV-positive, Tom is going to kill him. As they wait for the results, the hours go by, and Dan tries to engage Tom in conversation, to engage his sympathy, and to find a way to escape. As the two men talk and battle for control, Piccirillo flashes back to the recent past, and Tom's motives become more clear. The 24th Day was shown at the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival. ~ Josh Ralske, All Movie Guide\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Jill Lepore\\'s The Mansion of Happiness: A History of Life and Death&nbsp;(Knopf, 2012) is, mostly, a collection of her articles from The&nbsp;New Yorker&nbsp;in recent years, loosely grouped together under the broad themes of life and death. As Lepore notes in the preface, a \"history of life and death ... could include just about anything\" (xi), so with a few bits of transition text thrown in to tie the different articles together, she\\'s got herself a book.\\nLepore\\'s introduction, \"The Mansion of Happiness\" (originally published in 2007) is about Milton Bradley\\'s Checkered Game of Life, invented in 1860. As in most of the other chapters, Lepore uses some small thing as a touchstone and then ranges far afield: here, for example, she uses Bradley\\'s game to discuss the history of \"moral\" board games, Bradley\\'s biography, the afterlife of Life the game, &amp;c. And she lays the groundwork for the rest of the book, which is mapped out roughly chronologically based on the \"stages of life.\"\\nThe rest of the book proceeds apace. Lepore\\'s style sometimes feels a bit scattershot and rambling, but I say that in the nicest possible way. It\\'s fascinating to see how she makes connections and draws comparisons across time, space, and subject matter - it\\'s rather fun to see where she\\'s going to take you next. From breastfeeding to Stuart Little&nbsp;to Sylvester Graham to eugenics to parenting magazines to Karen Ann Quinlan, Lepore writes comfortably and with her characteristic wit.\\nE.B. White is a favorite of Lepore\\'s (as he is a favorite of mine), and he, like a few other names and topics, figures in more than a few of the chapters. The section of the book I enjoyed most, though (as I did the article on which it was based) was \"The Children\\'s Room,\" about NYPL children\\'s librarian Anne Carroll Moore and her opposition to White\\'s Stuart Little. This essay alone would make the book worth reading.\\nI was a bit surprised that the book\\'s notes don\\'t include citations to the original publications of these pieces; that\\'s covered, it seems, by a blanket note on the copyright page: \"Portions of this book originally appeared in The New Yorker.\" But I will say that I was very glad to see the endnotes at all, since they wouldn\\'t have been made available in the original publications.\\nAs she said at the outset, this book \"could include just about anything,\" and it does. It\\'s not, really, a \"history of life and death,\" but as a collection of essays broadly related to those topics, it works very nicely indeed.\\nhttp://philobiblos.blogspot.com/2012/08/book-review-mansion-of-happiness.html ',\n",

Every 24 hours she changes from a normal human teen into a demon killing machine. She has lived entirely alone with no real contact except with her father and now she is thrown into the truly scary world of human teens. Her father insists she attends *regular* high school since his boss's daughter is going to attend one as well. Bethany is pretty much cheerleader perfect while Kali is socially awkward and would rather kill than chat. So when Kali saves her life, the two are connected in really strange ways. So in a world where Darwin has not only discovered evolution, but also those non human, paranormal creatures. Those creature are roaming the earth but most humans can't really see them.\\nThis story was full of quirky characters, lots of action and very sharp and witty dialogue. I wanted nothing more than to read about Kali and Beth arguing while solving the mysteries that surround Kali and her true origins. Kali notes that Beth has a *infection* of the Chupacabra kind and tries to take the parasite away from Beth in order to save her life. She thinks when she turns non human, her lethal blood while put an end to it and she will never have to speak to Beth again. Yeah, it doesn't work out that way.\\n \\nI really found it interesting in how Kali has minimal contact with other humans yet, she ends up knowing that she is in the *loser* group when it comes to school. There are also remembrances of her mother that are touching. She has enough human in her to know things are just not right and that make her search for the truth. There are a lot of paranormal young adult books that use this outsider curse to move a plot forward, but this really worked for me. This is the first book by this author. although I did try Golden when it first came out, but didn't click with me. I may have to go try it again now. \",\n",

Males, who has spent years writing about, and actually talking to, youth, gives a very different answer.\\nA teen\\'s home situation is a much more reliable indicator of whether or not they will smoke, drink or abuse drugs than peer pressure or pop culture. In 1996, when teens were supposed to be abusing drugs in record numbers, about 100,000 adults were taken to hospital emergency rooms for heroin or cocaine emergencies; in the same year, only 1,000 teens made such a trip. Little-discussed aspects of the teen pregnancy \"epidemic\" are past sexual abuse of the girl, usually by a family member, and the large number of fathers that are over 20 years old. The media would seemingly rather reprint law enforcement press releases than actually analyze crime statistics. They also tend to lie about crime trends, even when they are going in the proper direction; not stretching the truth, or differing interpretations, but it is closer to saying that black is white and up is down.\\nThis is an eloquent and fascinating look at how badly young people are treated by their elders, filled to overflowing with numbers, graphs and statistics.

Having studied the storytelling art a little over the years Id boil the essence of a good story (regardless of whether it is told, written or shown) down to these attributes\\n* they must draw their audience in and make them feel connected to the events being described\\n* they must have a basic structure of beginning, middle and end\\n* they need at least one central character who encounters some form of conflict that prevents them from going along the path they had been taking\\n* they must invite, even prompt, the audience to picture or imagine the places, people and events that are being described\\n* they cannot offer an easy resolution to the issues or conflicts they are describing\\nFor me The Woodcutter ticks all of these boxes with gusto. The audience is drawn in by Hills wonderful depictions of Wolfs out-of-the ordinary young life in the forests of Cumbria and then a very early depiction of his fall from grace. Knowing that an author wouldnt willingly use up all their most dramatic material in the first few chapters of a novel the reader is left wondering what sort of theme this story will explore..redemption? wronged man? revenge? something else?\\nUsing several characters in addition to Wolf, Hill manages to present several versions of the truth, exploring the notion that whats true depends on the perspective and facts or knowledge a person has at any time. As a reader you are prepared to go along with each subtle variation of reality, never quite knowing where the whole thing is headed, but somehow always feeling confident that the resolution will be a satisfying and authentic one. Along the way there are splendidly depicted images of both the Cumbrian landscapes and the characters (including a terrific fictional dog) who are central to the story.\\nPart of the way Hill draws the reader in and keeps them glued is the interesting array of ideas and themes he explores along the way and unlike so many writers he does this, always, as part of the story. The book is a masterclass in the concept of showing not telling. He examines things like the way the British class structure plays out in contemporary society, the role and nature of the justice system and even takes a look modern psychiatry in a way that makes you think.\\nLiterary critic (and professional controversy-starter) Christopher Booker once claimed that there are only seven basic plots for stories and, if this is true, it must get harder to be original as they keep being re-told. In broad ways The Woodcutter is an age-old tale that youve heard a thousand times before (in fact it bears a strong resemblance to a 19th Century French adventure classic) but with its sparkling dialogue, intricate plot, wonderfully realised characters and the thought-provoking ideas it ponders it is utterly unique. I cannot think of any reader who would not enjoy this wonderful book, crime fiction fan or not, especially via the narration of English actor Jonathan Keeble whose mastery of accents and gender roles was, as always, outstanding.

       "  'comment': \"It is quite a pleasure, being scared. While most people would argue this statement, claiming that being frightened is not pleasurable in the slightest, nevertheless it is true. We go out of our way to be scared, either through literature and movies, or through the more visceral route of roller-coasters and bungee-jumping. But within this ever-growing need for thrills lies a problem; we are becoming inured to fright, becoming jaded by the horrific. What was once terrifying is now mundane, or so the audiences of today would have us believe. By remaining an arms length away from any emotional connection with the subject-matter, through a sort of ironic detatchment, we have become immune to the sheer thrill of what may lie beyond that door. It's a shame, as Richard Matheson's HELL HOUSE is a novel that cries for the reader's rapt attention and suspension of disbelief. If that can be achieved, then HELL HOUSE is a hell of a ride.\\nHELL HOUSE functions as a revved-up hounted house cousin to Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, taking Jackson's basic premise, and ratcheting up the adreneline. Matheson presents the story as a scientific test of the paranormal, as four disparate characters take up residence inside the infamous Belasco house, united together by the lure of money, and the hope that the evil can be dispelled. No time is wasted moving the story along, the characters entering the house in record time (page 12, I believe). As the story progresses over four deeply disturbing days, the characters find themselves increasingly affected by whatever forces inhabit the house. Florence, a medium, contacts the spirit of a young man who died within the walls. Dr. Barrett is obsessed with finding a mechanical means of dispelling the force. His wife, Edith, takes to sleepwalking. And Fischer has personal demons to battle, as well; he was the only survivor of a previous expedition.\\nUnlike Jackson's more sedate and internalized novel (the modern standard of haunted house stories), Matheson externalizes the horror in ever-increasing gruesomeness. The walls of the house are riddled with visions of obscenities. The manisfestations are decidedly physical, and unsubtle. Matheson seems to have a high time rubbing the reader's nose in every unpleasantness, every degradation. It is a testament to his skill as a writer that the reader never feels dirty afterwards. This is vivid and gruesome writing, but it never becomes exploitative. It sure teeters on the edge, though.\\nMatheson allows the story to flesh out the characters, their motivations and weaknesses slowly becoming apparent. This is as it should be, as the house preys on such fallibilities. And, as in the best novels of the genre, the house itself becomes a character, gradually revealing its weaknesses as well. Much like the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King's THE SHINING (which owes a great deal of debt to HELL HOUSE), the Belasco house is an entity unto itself, with a history so disturbing that it would take up a few more novels to fully expose its character. HELL HOUSE is not simply a series of events the human characters react to: it is alive, and wishes to remain so.\\nBut unlike Matheson's I AM LEGEND, which completely re-imagines the vampire myth as an apocalyptic nightmare, HELL HOUSE does not re-invent the haunted house novel. Unlike THE SHINING, it does not create a personal empathy with the reader through the downfall of its characters. HELL HOUSE is an homage to the haunted house, adding modern sensibilities to the genre. It raises the gore level and sexual content beyond that of previous attempts, which is a mixed blessing. Matheson can sustain the story through his abilities as an author, but how many novels have been written since that present the reader with blood instead of scares, with guts in place of horror? \\nAnd perhaps that is a problem HELL HOUSE can't overcome. HELL HOUSE's scares, as pleasurable as they are, may not be able to overcome the jaded nature of today's audience, who prefer to view horror as 'camp'. I recall with dismay a recent viewing of the re-release of THE EXORCIST, and hearing many audience members laugh at particularly upsetting scenes. HELL HOUSE requires a suspension of disbelief, a rare commodity these days; if that can be achieved, it becomes a frightening tale of terror, concerned with nothing so much as scaring the wits out of you. \",\n",

As she states in her introduction: \"The interest in the unknown, but knowable, which moves the mystery story writer moves the science fiction writer as well. In consequence, both writers often turn out to be the same person.\" With contributions from Isaac Asimov, Poul and Karen Anderson, Fritz Leiber, and many others, this is no throw-away anthology. The stories are carefully selected, expertly written, and really do a nice job of combining the two genres.

       "  'comment': \"I've read a few books by Devin O'Branagan and each book is a bit different from the other. Each book carries strong messages and each one deals with spirituality in one form or another. Threshold focuses on spirituality, religion and near death experience, and well as family relationships and prejudices. It's all in there forming an interesting story of a young boy who drowns, the shaman/family friend who saves him and the family and town that is ultimately affected by events that were set in motion from the day of the drowning. In fact, one could say that things had been brewing even before that day...\\nCole is the young teen or preteen who drowns; his drowning and near death experience changes his attitude and pulls him into a journey of thought and self discovery. His older sister, Leah is full of anger and angst. She's almost 18 and has been a surrogate parent to Cole and Rachel, the youngest of the family since their mother abruptly left them years ago. Rachel, elementary aged, has portentious dreams and a serious love of all things chocolate. All of O'Branagan's books feature at least one main character dog, and Wigglebutt is the dog star. And then there's the dad, Ty - who is trying his cowboy best to be a good dad, but the kids don't feel the love.\\nOther strong characters include Elijah, the Native America shaman, who has strong mystical powers yet he's dealing with his own demons of abstaining from alcohol, with a wife and son who have issues.\\nThe seemingly ideal little town, where the inhabitants are close, have their own problems seething under the surface and Cole's drowning and near death experience seems to uncover these problems. Problems such as complacency, bigotry, depression and alcoholism. A hate group seems drawn to the small town, adding to the mix. Elijah's tribe is divided and committing violent acts on some of their own. The Pastor's wife seems full of hate. The Babtist minister seems just as full of non-acceptance...and on top of everything else, Cole - a young almost teen seems determined to sacrifice himself for the good of many others.\\nThreshold is the story of how things come to a suspenseful and tragic head, and how Cole's family, Elijah's family and the town seem to become damaged and yet still manage to pull together and bounce back.\\nSome bad things happen to people - some ugly truths are exposed and yet everyone manages to come to an acceptance and forgive each other. So even though parts of this story may seem heartbreaking, there is that thread of optimism that most of us are so good at keeping.\\nI enjoyed reading this book. I think in one way or another we've all had to deal with one or more of the issues brought up in Threshold. I'd definitely recommend Threshold for a good fiction read with not one, but a few good messages.\\nDevin O'Branagan is the author of numerous books, including Red Hot Liberty. \",\n",

I certainly enjoyed Wise Man's Fear. I'm a fast and patient reader who loves being immersed in another world, and so I don't usually mind a slow-paced plot. But at the end of WMF, I felt like neither the plot or Kvothe's character had really advanced much at all from the previous book. Past-Kvothe, that is - I remain quite intrigued with present-day Kvothe in the inn. For me, the scenes at the inn were the most tense and involving portions of the book. But as I said, Rothfuss's style is so engaging that I floated happily along even through his more meandering scenes. Who knows, perhaps events in the third book will cast this one in an entirely new light; but even if not, I still consider my time with WMF well spent. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Like his classic THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE, perhaps 90% of this book consists of dialogue. There is no back story. Everything the reader knows is revealed through the characters conversations. But very rarely do these conversations seem like exposition. Instead, they come across as the day-to-day thoughts and concerns of a handful of men (women are basically background noise in this book) for whom stealing, beating, and killing are just part of their jobs. They discuss their marriages, the sexual habits of their victims, the perils of prison life (in explicit detail), and the continual problems of getting their jobs done, such as dealing with a killer who seems to have lost his taste for anything but liquor and women or trying to earn enough money to finance a big crime by committing small ones--stealing and selling rich peoples dogs. Money plays a big role here--there is never enough of it, and it isnt as easy to come by as one might think. Only the cold-blooded title character, Cogan, seems to have much control over what he is doing. He is a precise man who appreciates a job well done.\\nAs brutal and occasionally stupid as these characters are, they come to life in Higgins brilliant, no-holds-barred dialogue--and you can feel their pain and even sometimes sympathize with them. Many of the conversations that make up the book take place in cars as the characters proceed from one crime to another. Everything seems completely real and Higgins plot weaves several threads together to build the foundation for the inevitable conclusion. It takes a writer of special skill to bring together such a despicable collection of human beings wallowing in crime and violence--and to make you enjoy it. If you liked EDDIE COYLE, you must read this one. ',\n",

Max, aware from an early age of his attraction to men, finally comes out to his father after he has established a firm relationship with his lover Nick, whom he meets under interesting circumstances while staying in Italy.

The Peters does not even make note of human sacrifices while Jennings may give some people nightmares. Peters infuses a little too much European culture into the Incan society, in my opinion. My editorial deletions would have included his use of the terms, \"My Lord\" and \"My Lady.\" I prefer Jennings use of first person narrative and his ability to give respect while still showing the faults in the Aztec culture. Peters idealizes the Incas but he did show how faulty politics led to their downfall. Social drama drives most of the book so people with limited patience in exploring relationships should be wary of this novel.

       "  'comment': 'The youngest Mann: Actor Michael Degen takes known facts about the Thomas Mann family and weaves them into a moving and insightful novel, told in the third person but clearly from the perspective of the youngest child Michael Mann. The cover illustration shows \"Poschi,\" the gorgeously gracious, much loved home of the Thomas Mann family on Poschinger Street in Munich before World War II. Thomas Mann would write, creating his brilliant novels and stories, in the mornings, then take an afternoon nap with his devoted wife Katia in lounge chairs on the curved veranda. He -- famously talented, she -- wealthy and cultured. Their closest friends are from the cultural elite, including musical geniuses such as Bruno Walter. They have six gifted children: Erika, Golo, Elisabeth, Klaus, Monika and the youngest Michael. The youngest was born in the disastrous year 1919, when Germany\\'s defeat destroyed the infrastructure of the country and even the wealthy faced food shortages and hardships. And Michael embodied disaster. From early infancy he was given to fits and tantrums that disrupted the picture perfect family life. Thomas Mann who needs peace and calm to write, develops an intense disgust at the very sight of his youngest, and Katia, ever loyal to her genius husband, has mixed feelings about the boy as well. But they care for him. Thomas Mann gives his own abandoned violin to the boy, who clearly loves music, but the boy just has one problem at school after another. Exile during the Nazi period, and leaving Poschi behind for Switzerland, intensifies the built-in anguish in the family, and Michael leaves home early to escape. In the middle of all these family dynamics, there is a brief mention of Thomas Mann\\'s anxiety about retrieving his diaries from Poschi after they have fled. He cannot rest until the diaries are safely with him again. (A detail that plays out tragically at the end...) Michael develops as a highly intelligent, musically talented son, who studies his father\\'s novels and then endures huge psychological pain when he finds his own behavior in one of his father\\'s characters, \"the biter.\" Michael spends many hours practicing the violin, and then slugs his music teacher in a fit of anger. The embarrassment all around is beyond grief. Michael enters a happier phase of life with a Swiss girl, Gret, who becomes a wonderful wife to him and loving mother to their two beautiful sons, Frido and Toni, whom Thomas Mann and Katia fall in love with, dote on endlessly. They establish a good life in Monterey, Michael is a success with the San Francisco Symphony. Thomas Mann consults with Michael on the history of 12 tone music, and incorporates this information in his latest novel Dr. Faustus, this makes Michael happy. He still has fits of anger, intensified by alcohol and drug abuse. At one point he slugs Gret. Then later on a successful concert tour he slugs Yahltah Menuhin, his accompanist and briefly his lover. This will not end well. Frido perfers living with his grandparents. Michael gives up music. He almost lands on his feet again: he goes to Harvard for a PhD in German studies and gets a professorship in German at Berkeley. He is asked to edit his father\\'s diaries, which have all the details of his childhood that he knew but is forced to confront anew on the page in his father\\'s handwriting. All this is factual. In the end Michael inevitably succumbs to depression to the drugs and alcohol. Too short a life, but what a life it was. In all of this detail, no word about what the average reader must be thinking: all these symptoms seem to indicate some kind of early childhood brain damage, such as lead paint poisoning or trauma of some kind. But not a word of what caused his inability to exercise self control. You just see the pain from the family\\'s perspective. Still, a meaningful life, deserving a full biographical treatment such as this. The novel is a beautiful human document. (NB There is a sly reference on page 135 to a character in Thomas Mann\\'s Buddenbrooks, the oleaginous Herr Gruenlich, which is the character that Degen played for a German TV serial based on the novel. The book probably has other hidden clues that I missed....) ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Here\\'s what I like in a mystery: well-developed characters, suspense, and a complex plot that requires the sleuth to prove their skill or intellect.\\nWhat was missing from this mystery: all the above.\\nAt first I was encouraged by the English teacher-as-sleuth, the opening quotes in each chapter from woman authors like Stevie Smith, Virginia Woolf, and Toni Morrison, and a the literary discussion around the edges of the plot. The mystery was pretty standard stuff: a female professor is found dead on the campus of a women\\'s college, and it\\'s deemed a suicide until information comes to light making murder a possibility.\\nKate Fansler, the aforementioned English teacher, is called in to investigate. Why? I\\'m not sure. She had a tenuous connection to the victim, Patrice Umphelby, having met her once while waiting for a delayed flight. Kate is also connected to two men writing Patrice\\'s biography, who have put their project on hold until the circumstances of her death are known. The college brings Kate on board, ostensibly to take part in an academic task force, but really to give her free rein to talk to anyone on staff as part of her investigation.\\nAnd talk she does. Most of the \"action\" involves Kate attending meetings or cocktail parties, and inquiring about Patrice. People are clearly divided -- love her or hate her -- and they make their opinions known. Two camps emerge, Kate tramps around New York and New England consuming Laphroig whiskey, and then, ta da! With ten pages to go she explains what happened, everyone is very thankful, the end.\\nThis was all way too simple for me. Yes, it was murder, not suicide. Surprise, someone who hated Patrice did it. I could have guessed that early on, but dismissed the notion, expecting the plot to be more complex. There was no suspense involved in nabbing the perpetrator -- there was only Kate, quaffing another whiskey, basking in the admiration of those who should have been able to figure this out for themselves.\\nThis is the seventh book in a series, and maybe I\\'ve missed something by not reading the back story. But I\\'m probably not going to find out. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'This book argues that despite its claims, Zionism has produced in the Israeli state not a democracy, but a liberal ethnocracy (307) based on fictitious claims about the Jewish people that derive from a nationalization of the Bible and its transformation into a reliable history book that took place between the 1850s and the 1930s. Bold, highly intelligent, artfully written, and well translated, this scholarly volume on the historiography of the notion of a Jewish people was a best-seller in Israel in 2008. Sand is a notable historian of ideas with extraordinarily acute powers of analysis, and he is able dispassionately and with flair to unravel the elements of intricate combinations of history, culture, and religion. Americans used to reading mainstream media fodder about Israel and the Middle East will find Sands approach eye-opening and presented at a level that is several orders of intellectual magnitude removed from the tired shibboleths with which they are familiar. The book is addressed to an educated readership cognizant both of world history and of modern politics. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'A couple of disclosures before I begin this review. First, I know the author as we went to college together and more importantly were both DJ\\'s at the college radio station, WCWM. Second, I\\'ve always been drawn to \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" - partly because I grew up 45 minutes from the town in New York (then known as North Tarrytown) and visited frequently - and the Headless Horseman is a prominent feature of Blackwell\\'s novel. The story is part crime novel, part thriller, part supernatural and an original amalgam of all the above. Set in a small town in Virginia, two reporters for a local paper Quinn and Kate have to deal with the return of serial killer who tormented the town a dozen years earlier. This would be bad enough but each character has personal demons to face as well, some of which appear in very tangible forms. There are a few flaws to the book as events transpire and relationships form far too rapidly to be believable. I also wonder why when Quinn runs a journalist\\'s writings through software that can help identify the author why he doesn\\'t do the same with the letters of the serial killer Lord Halloween (other than that the mystery would have been solved a hundred pages earlier). These flaws can be overlooked though because this book really is a page turner and has moments of being very unsettling and very humorous. The ending promises a sequel that I forward to reading.

       "  'comment': 'From Publishers Weekly\\nRuth, a Minneapolis wife and mother, bakes to relax the way others do yoga. And it\\'s a good thing she does, because a house full of cantankerous family members seriously challenges her ability to remain serene in this fluffy, enjoyable third novel by Ray (Julie and Romeo; Step-Ball-Change). Cake is Ruth\\'s version of Zen, allowing her to lose herself in the ritual of familiar smells and precise measurements. She\\'s dealing well with her moody teen daughter, Camille; college student son, Wyatt; and sometimes cantankerous live-in mother, Hollis. She\\'s even handling husband Sam\\'s recent unemployment. But when Guy, Ruth\\'s oft-estranged father and Hollis\\'s ex-husband, is left physically helpless after an injury and must join the chaotic household, just how much cake will she have to bake to save her sanity? The answer is predictably uplifting. Ruth falls right in line with Ray\\'s past harried heroines: she is a cheerful and good-natured caretaker who doesn\\'t neglect herself, but whose happiness and identity is utterly intertwined with her family\\'s. Ray\\'s dialogue is ripe with practical wisdom (\"`Oh, there\\'s order in the world all right. It just might not be the order you want\\'\"), and her style is warm and lightly funny (\"My mother looked at me as if I had told her I was going to move to Memphis and join an Elvis cult\"). Ray has a proven talent for everyday dramas of family life, and her latest is as toothsome as its predecessors.\\nCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

       "  'comment': 'It\\'s hard to imagine that this book started as an experiment by John Scalzi to see if he could write a novel. He ended up creating a wonderful story of alien first contact built upon the base of all of Scalzi\\'s novels - creative plot and story-telling mixed with amazing dialogue.\\n\"Agent to the Stars\" is a story of first contact, where space produces alien good guys and Hollywood produces human bad guys. The premise is terrific...Joshua is an alien representing his race who were drawn to Earth by our 70+ years of TV and Radio signals. The aliens want help with their introduction to the planet. And so naturally, they\\'ve reached out to a talent agent - Tom Stein. As Joshua says, \"We look like snot. And we smell like dead fish. We have seen \"The Blob\" and it is us. We need an agent to get us the role of the friendly aliens.\"\\nFans of John Scalzi will recognize a few things. First, snappy and witty dialogue keeps the story moving at a fantastic pace. One can\\'t help but compare the character interactions across several of Scalzi\\'s books, but I was particularly struck by how similar the interplay was between Stein and his assistant Miranda, and Scalzi\\'s \"Last Colony\"/\"Zoe\\'s Tale\" characters John Perry and his assistant Savitri. \\nThe aliens have loads of personality, but like the Obin in the world of Scalzi\\'s \"Old Man\\'s War\", they have the ability to share consciousness across their entire race. These aliens also have the ability move consciousness from one living vessel to another. I won\\'t give away too much of the fun plot line, but in the context of what Scalzi would go on to write, it\\'s a lot of fun to see him start playing with and crafting this premise. There\\'s a little bit of a deus ex machina in this vein, but Scalzi is a deft writer and carries it off.\\nIn his introduction, Scalzi states that he made minimal updates to the book in its current iteration. He spent a little time updating some of the pop culture references which fall from the page like candy from a machine. As usual, Scalzi\\'s characters are well-shaped and interesting. \\nIt was such a fantastic read that I was saddened by coming to the end.\\nThe book is light and only serious in parts. But make no mistake, the book is seriously good. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Emily's Dress and Other Missing Things is a true delight and it provided me with one of the most memorable and unique reading experiences I have ever had! This book is in a category all on it's own. Kathryn Burak has a beautiful writing style that is very poetic and flows so well. I had no idea what to expect when I started reading this book but I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a story that combines mystery, a budding romance, Emily Dickinson, sadness, friendship, loss, adventure and emotional recovery. \\nClaire is the protagonist and she is very multilayered. She's been through quite a bit and her history really helps the reader understand what makes her the way she is. She's lost more than one person in her life and that had a definite impact on her. She's very different, but not in a bad way. It's really sort of hard to explain, but I found her to be quite refreshing in her sincerity and uniqueness. I'm not going to reveal much, but I will say that Claire's ties to Emily Dickinson feel very real and touching. You have to read this book to really be able to bask in the beauty of it. \\nI really enjoyed some of the other characters in this book as well, like Tate. Tate is a student teacher for one of Claire's classes and through a series of uncanny events, these two end up forming a close bond. There were a lot of funny situations involving these two, as well as some emotional ones. I adore Tate: he's one of the few people in Claire's life that really connects with her and understands her. Claire's best friend, Tess, is another noteworthy character. She's the kind of friend that accepts you no matter what and I really liked her!\\nOne of my favorite things about this book is the poetry: it is so wonderful and significant. Claire's character writes poetry and due to the personal nature of her poems, I really felt like this further invited me into her world as a reader and allowed me to connect with her on another level. Some of Emily Dickinson's poetry is also discussed and mentioned, which really made me want to sit down and explore her writing further.\\nI highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a tremendously good story filled with amazing characters and an exciting plot that will move you in several ways! \",\n",

If it weren't for the fact that it's a subject matter that strikes close to home for anyone who has loved, much less loved and lost permanently, this wouldn't be a great book. However, the subject matter strikes a chord, and that's what saves this book from being less than average. It was enough to make even me tear up, and I'm known for being cold-hearted. \",\n",

This burning questions have been with me ever since I can remember! When watching cartoons as a kid I remember how at the beginning of the show something will catch the attention of one of the main characters, then somebody proceeds to explain the science behind it and right there! Right there you know thats how the day issue will be resolve the most clear example of this retarded device I can think of is from a crappy movie (I dont remember the name) where some serial killer gets digitalized and start killing people from the cyber world at the beginning of the movie the mother of the main character attaches a bunch of computer disc to the fridge by using magnets, the main character explains to her that you are not supposed to do that with computer stuff cuz the magnets destroy the information right there you know thats how they kill the cyber killer! And big surprise at the end they drive him to an industrial magnet and kill him and I start banging my head against the wall! <b> But Alfonso, what the fuck that has to do with this book</b> Im about to tell you right now so dont worry! But first let me name the technique! Since nobody has been able to tell me how it is (and I asked Mr. Greg, Seth and Karen and several teachers in high school, college, I asked the hobo that used to sit around my bus stop and nobody knows!!!) so I Alfonso Gutierrez!

It all started nice and pretty with the electrified fence and it got to the point of ridiculous with the clock arena and sector 13, the coil wire thingy, the flaw in the invisible shields! Dear jesus christ! I think Suzanne Collins has Framing Device tourettes !!! There is no other explanation! \\n\\nThere I said it! This book is crappy!

       "  'comment': \"Little did I realize as I sit here at my own cottage that this novel takes place over several successive summers at a lake cottage. I'm certain that that description so many years ago was a major selling point for me in buying the book but it's been so very long since I bought it and consigned it to the unread bookshelves that I had forgotten. I have a deep and abiding love for our own summer place so there are very few things more appealing to me to read than something set in a similar place. The fact that this book also hints at darker themes does nothing to diminish the appeal even as I hope that none of the darkness looming in this novel ever pervades my own summer idyll. \\nDanny is a young teenager when her family decides to stop renting at Rainy Lake and to invest in a cottage of their own. Her mother falls for a slightly ramshackle home, trusting that her architect husband will be able to repair and renovate the place. And at first that is what happens. But the pressures of the times start to wear on everyone and the undercurrents threaten to swamp the family. Danny's father is unhappy at his firm and leaves to start his own business. Her adored older brother, extremely liberal in his thinking (he is furious when the local community club automatically votes to exclude a black family and he is adamantly against the Vietnam War), becomes as unbendingly rigid as those idealogues whom he opposes. Unable to hide his growing contempt for their father's compromises and increased drinking, he is growing angrier and more distant from the family. Their mother holds desperately to some new semblence of normal, trying to weather the brewing storm and make it through to calm waters. \\nTold in Danny's voice through several summers, the book skips through life at home, showing flashes of the discord that, at least in the beginning, dissipates once they hit Rainy Lake. But even the magic of the summer and the lake cannot hold off the rising tension that threatens to take them all under. Not only does the novel detail the disintegrating family but it also captures Danny's coming of age from the first time she lays eyes on Billy Dove, the half black, half white boy who challenges her brother's and friends' proclaimed color-blindness, to the day when she says goodbye to Rainy Lake as she prepares to leave for college. \\nThere is a lot of humor in the telling of this book, despite the themes of racism, alcoholism, the rightness of the Vietnam War, and how liberalism can ultimately fail when embodied in people who only know privilege. Danny's desire to protect the nesting bats who have been in their cottage far longer than they have will ring true for anyone who has ever inhabited an old home. And her mother's raging fear of those same bats, driving her to sleep under the covers with her hair wound into a bath towel will make many summer home denizens chuckle. \\nRockcastle has managed to evoke the halcyon days of summer on a lake while still showing the ways in which the lake is not as insulated from the outside world as a young teenager might perhaps think. And when the completely unthinkable happens and anger and tragedy and grief invade the idyll, Rockcastle has managed to be completely pitch perfect. This a coming of age in a time when so much roiled beneath the surface and so much more wasn't spoken about and yet through her wonderful and insightful narrator, we, the readers, are privy to not only the adult takes on each issue but the uncomplicated and innocent children's view as well. This is a wonderful read at any time but is particularly apt right now in the hazy, lazy days of summer. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I added this book to my to read list when I noticed the beautiful cover. I love the starry night sky! Then I read the synopsis and it read like a Jodi Picoult story. I was even more convinced I wanted to read it. Somewhere along the way I lost track of it. And when I noticed it again, I read the reviews and noticed that a lot of people were not saying good things about it. So I set it aside.\\nThen a few weeks ago, I had a long trip planned and needed to load up my ereader with library books. A lot of my choices were not available, but this one was. So, even though I didnt expect to like it much, I added it to my iPad, because it cost me nothing to try it and not finish. Im so glad I did!\\nMatt is a talented, dedicated neurosurgeon. Elle is a bright, recently retired astronaut. They have known each other since the day Elle was born and loved each other almost as long! One day Matt receives a call from his partner saying he needs to be in ER stat! His beautiful wife has had an accident. When Matt arrives, he realizes there is no hope for her; she is brain dead! He also knows that the only thing that Elle was more afraid of than dying, was NOT dying when her condition was hopeless. So he realizes he will make the choice to have her removed from life support. UNTIL.....he learns she is pregnant! He quickly decides she will be kept alive in order to give the baby a chance to live. That would not be a problem, except that his family, his mother and his brother-in-law, decide that Elle should NOT be on life support; that she has made it clear she did not want to live this way. A legal battle ensues.\\nThere are no bad guys in this story. Every character acts as he does because he believes he is doing the right thing, and they all act out of love. But the question is.... what is the right thing to do in this situation. There is a lot to think about as you read and ponder how you would act, and a lot to discuss. The book has a reading group guide at the back. The Promise of Stardust would be a great pick for a book club! \\nThis is the authors debut novel. I cant wait to read more from her!\\nMy Rating: 1/2 4-1/2 Stars ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'When I was younger I picked up Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury. I was bored to death and put it down. My sister-in-law, a high school English teacher, was using it in her class last year and I told her what I thought of it. She asked that I try reading it again and so I picked it up at the local library. Its a small book and Im very glad I did.\\nThe main character of this book, Guy Montag, is a fireman but his job is not to put fires out but to burn books. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns. Through an encounter with 17 year-old Clarisse McClellan and retired English professor, Faber, he realizes his dissatisfaction with life. Mildred, his wife, escapes her meaningless existence by surrounding herself with wall-sized TV screens, calling the TV characters \"family.\" The drone of warplanes overhead is drowned out by commericialism and entertainment so that people go on with their lives based on what they are told and led to believe is normal without using their own minds. This book is a passionate commentary against mindlessness. Through Montags awakened understanding of the doldrums of life in the future and his limited connections with others he begins to question his wifes, his coworkers and his existence and what he was doing for a living. People just sort of disappear and there really isnt much questioning of what happened. I heard she died or something is basically his wifes reaction and didnt give it much more thought than that. The reason I didnt like this book the first time I tried to read it was because it was SO boring. This last time I read it I understood that the point was just that-boredom. He didnt have much to do, didnt talk to people, didnt have much passion about his wife and didnt even remember the last time they talked, really talked or when they met. If you are able to sit down one evening knowing what they book is about-Id say its worth your time. Check it out and come let me know what you thought. Thanks. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"An in-depth look at the nature of stress and the effects that it has on our bodies. The main idea here is that our reaction to stress evolved to be useful in a particular kind of acute, fight-or-flight situation, but the biological responses that are very helpful when you're spending ten minutes running away from a lion can be anything but helpful when you're sitting around all day fretting about how you're going to pay your mortgage. Actually, just reading this book can be pretty stressful, with its endless litany of horrible things that your worrying is probably doing to your body right this minute, although the author does at least try to end things on a comforting and hopeful note.\\nThis is definitely for people who are interested in the biological details of what happens in our bodies under stress: which hormones are released when, what they do, how they interact with each other, and how they have the effects they have. It was, perhaps, sometimes a little more detail than I really wanted, but Sapolsky leavens it all with humor and a pleasantly informal style, and does a good job of not insulting the reader's intelligence while being entertainingly sympathetic about how confusing some of it is.\\nThe version I have is the third edition, published in 2004, which apparently is significantly revised and contains a couple of new chapters, including one on sleep and stress, a topic that is particularly relevant to me as a shift-worker. \",\n",

Is Ferris boek alleen een reclamespot voor zijn eigen succesverhaal, of bevat het lessen voor ons allemaal. Ferris (1978) is enerzijds het toonbeeld van de American Dream: als je echt wilt, kun je slagen in het leven. Anderzijds prikt hij ook nuchter door de inproductiviteit van het huidige bedrijfsleven, maakt hij handig gebruik van Friedmans The World Is Flat, Andersons Long Tail en de nieuwe wetmatigheden die gelden voor een Web Worker en e-business. Lastige aspecten als het combineren van een mobiele levensstijl met een gezin, de korte levenscyclus van producten of de ethische aspecten op lange termijn van outsourcing puur vanwege de kosten laat Tim links liggen. Hij is eerlijk over oppervlakkige marketingprincipes die bijvoorbeeld leidden tot de titel van het boek. Degene die het hele boek leest en niet een recensie schrijft op basis van de inleiding of de omslag, snapt dat er langer dan 4 uur gewerkt wordt, en uitbouwen van je eigen bedrijf naast een betaalde kantoorbaan niet zonder slag of stoot gaat.\\nNatuurlijk, voor minipensioenen (geniet van het leven, stel dat niet uit tot je 65e), uitbesteden van uitzoekklussen, organisatie van evenementen, productie, distributie en afhandeling van goederen is er veel meer mogelijk dan je denkt. Daarvoor helpen diverse oefeningen, voorbeelden, referenties en berekeningen in dit boek. Dat je met intensieve training best kampioen tangodansen of zoiets kunt worden, bewijzen Nederlandse televisieseries als Idols, Sterren dansen op het ijs en Mijn man kan niet dansen. Ferris tips om je cv op te krikken en indruk te maken op investeerders, mediavertegenwoordigers of universiteiten grenzen aan leugens om eigen bestwil. Hecht dus niet teveel waarde aan zijn gastdocentschap aan Princeton University. Wat als iemand zich op zon manier bij Ferris zelf naar binnen zou smoezen? Het echt onderscheidend vermogen van voedingssupplementen, snelleescursussen en t-shirts is natuurlijk ver te zoeken. En wat te denken van de Nieuwe Rijken, niet noodzakelijkerwijs miljonairs, maar  conform Timothy Ferris eigen drang om als een popster te leven  wel genoeg in de slappe was om er regelmatig tussenuit te knijpen om te ontdekken dat je onder de 20 dollar geen fatsoenlijke maaltijd in een Londens restaurant kunt krijgen.\\nIn Een werkweek van 4 uur is geen aandacht voor leiding geven aan mensen, het oplossen van conflicten, samenwerken of echt innoveren, wel voor Management by absence, bedrijfs- en organisatiemodellen die slechts in een beperkt aantal sectoren opgeld doen. Het zijn dezelfde makken die boeken als De aarde is plat hebben: in de digitale wereld, waar alles door een draadje kan, gaat het verhaal op. Doctoren, vervoerders, wegenbouwers, producenten van de t-shirts, voedingssupplementen e.d. organiseren zich anders. Dat Ferris put uit het Grote Citatenboek voor managementliteratuur\\nEn hoewel de Nieuwe Rijken een belangrijke rol in het boek spelen, zegt Ferris dat geld verdienen niet het doel is. Hij besluit het boek met het ontwijken van concrete antwoorden op de vraag naar de zin van het leven. Hier toont hij een slimme mix van oosterse filosofie en Amerikaans kortetermijndenken: het leven heeft geen hogere zin of betekenis, als je slim bent geniet je gewoon van het hier en nu. Conclusie: voor mensen die erover denken hun eigen bedrijf op te zetten, bevat het boek veel waardevolle lessen. Als je bij je huidige baas op de wip zit, maar eigenlijk niet durft te vertrekken, kan Timothy Ferris je aardig helpen. Voel je niet schuldig als je elke dag met plezier naar je werk gaat. ',\n",

And with a different main character. It felt like a case of telling not showing- you know that Mary is different, that she thinks of a world beyond her home fences, she is a thinking, feeling, strong girl. At least, that's what you're told. From what I could see, however, she was a sulky and dim character, disliking the strict regulations of home but unable to go against them in the matter of love, to find a solution that would make her and two friends very happy. You could kind of see her as a less charismatic and resourceful Scarlett O'Hara. \\nI think the ending redeemed it a little though, it wasn't happy, it wasn't easy, it moved away from romance. However, since it's got a sequel, it could yet turn out that way... \",\n",

And very often it comes down to try and fail.And I won't give much more away, because the nature of these sorts of books is such that you really don't want to be spoiled for the true nature of the games and what obstacles are coming up, etc.Girls start to achieve a little parity with boys in this one, though it's still very skewed toward the main character's gender and the boys he's hanging out with.We get some more clues as to what's going on. The main character recovers some more of his memories. But, in general, this is definitely a series you'll have to see all the way to the end for any of it to be remotely satisfying.I just hope it has a satisfactory conclusion and all my questions are answered unlike a certain television show with polar bears I could mention by name but will not. \",\n",

It's interesting to hear the perspective from someone who is actually from a third world country instead of an American or European conservationist. Mishra shows protecting tigers from extinction is very complex and difficult. The book is a mixture of personal stories, history, biology and the current state of tigers. 2010 was the Year of the Tiger and this was an excellent contribution, I applaud Mishra for his dedication and work. He also lead me to an obscure book Tiger for Breakfast which I hope to read soon. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Julie Kagawas take on faeries and their world is simply extraordinary. With flawless writing, a magical world and an extremely well developed cast of characters, some of which stem from Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream, The Iron King proves to be a phenomenal debut and a must-read.\\nIn The Iron King we are introduced to our heroine, Meghan Chase, a somewhat insecure girl with a simple, boring life. When her little brother Ethan is kidnapped and replaced with a malicious changeling and her best friend since childhood, Robbie Goodfell, reveals he is actually Robin Goodfellow aka Puck from A Midsummer Nights Dream, Meghans once blas life turns upside down as she journeys into the Nevernever to save Ethan, incidentally discovering who she really is in the process. Right away, the once insecure girl finds her bravery, determined to save her little brother.\\nMs. Kagawas vivid descriptions made it easy for me to get lost in the world of Nevernever. I felt like I was part of the story, right alongside the characters I had come to love so much. Kagawas talent to seamlessly weave action, adventure and romance into one book without either one being overwhelming is impeccable. Lots of times in other books, the big battle scenes can be dragged out and become a bit arduous to read. But the action sequences were extremely well written in The Iron King and I didnt once find my attention drifting elsewhere.\\nOf course, the story would not be complete without a love triangle. I dont think I can say Ive ever read a book with a love triangle where Ive actually loved both guys vying for the girls affection. But both Puck and Ash have completely stolen my heart. Pucks playful banter and whimsical sense of humor never failed to make me laugh and Prince Ashs broody, tough exterior yet secretly caring personality had me swooning. Now, I hate to pick just one, but if I had to, it would probably be Ash since I like him just a teensy bit more. The intense chemistry Meghan has with him is just too much! Any time he showed Megan the tiniest hint of affection, my heart would flutter and my stomach would clench as if it were happening to me.\\nAnd how could I forget Grimalkin? He. Is. So. Adorable. I felt that Kagawa captured the finicky essence of a cat perfectly with him. He was hilarious with his snooty attitude and sarcastic comments. I absolutely adored how he didnt bother to pay anyone any attention until he was through grooming himself, which is exactly like my own cat!\\nOverall, The Iron King was a magical, transcendent start to a series and is sure to be one of my favorites for a long time to come. My only regret is not reading it sooner! But, if I read it when it came out, I wouldnt have been able to read multiple books in the series at onceso I guess I cant regret it too much when I got to stay in a story world I loved for days as opposed to just hours. ;) My reviews for The Iron Daughter and The Iron Queen, the next installments in the series, will be up soon!

       "  'comment': \"Ivan Doig has penned a second historical novel that features the former school teacher from The Whistling Season. Now using the name Morrie Morris, he arrives by train in the post-WWI copper mining city of Butte, Montana. The railway has lost his travel trunk, and Morrie shortly gains the unwanted attention of a couple of Anaconda Mining Company thugs on the lookout for outside agitators seeking to organize mine workers. Concerned with keeping his family history concealed, Morrie finds employment first as a funeral 'cryer' followed shortly with a position as assistant to the director of the Butte Public Library, a former cattle rancher with his own legendary past. Friendship with a pair of retired Welsh minors who live at the same boarding house, a reunion with a former student, and his fledgling relationship with a widowed landlord all lead to Morrie's further entanglement in the plight of Butte's mine laborers. Doig's development of unique and oftentimes quirky characters that are enfolded into historical tales of western settlement and expansion contribute to another interesting book - - not to be missed.

       "  'comment': \"This was an interesting sort of werewolf book spent a lot of time talking about pack dynamics in the New World while exploring two damaged characters. Our male main character is Andrew Dare who is working as the enforcer for the Roanoke Pack. He had spent some time in Europe but is back home after losing his mate and going on a killing rampage to get those responsible for her death. He came back with a very bad reputation, lots of guilt, and an essential feeling of loneliness. He is in the Roanoke Pack but not really accepted by it. He is an alpha wolf who doesn't want responsibility for anyone but himself.\\nAndrew is sent to track down a lone wolf and finds Silver. She has been injected with silver, has lost her wolf, has hallucinations and is generally crazy. She sees a black wolf she calls Death who talks in the voices of those who have died. When Andrew finds her, he wants to find out where she belongs and wants to find out who did that to her and stop him before he does it again. Using silver as a weapon of torture is something that had been done in Europe but wasn't common in America. His pack alpha wants to get rid of Silver but has no interest in finding the person responsible. As long as he stays out of his territory, he doesn't care who caused the problem.\\nAndrew decides to disregard his alpha's instructions and find out what is going on. He wants to help Silver. Together they go off to the West Coast to try to find a pack that knows her.The story is told alternately from Andrew's and Silver's point of view. Getting into the mind of a woman who has been poisoned by silver was a very surreal experience. It was fascinating to see her relationship with Death and it was fascinating to see her come to terms with her horrible memories and come back to reality. \\nThis was a story of growth and change for both main characters set in an interesting world with a new mythology. It wasn't action packed. More time was spent on each characters' internal struggles than on external actions. I recommend it for fans of werewolf stories who want a quieter, more introspective book. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"A delightful book. If you liked [Saras Key] or [The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane] (two I've read), you may enjoy the interplay of past and present . Rebecca, a modern woman who curates museum exhibits, receives her greataunts journals from her stay in Jerusalem and decides to travel there also. While Rebecca feels some similarity in their situations, this aspect is not followed through. Neither is the death of an elderly Jew, which Zara witnesses upon arrival in the Holy Land, and a similar death witnessed by her new friend, Elizabeth. But since Zaras story is written as excerpts from journal entries , letters, or articles, I didnt really miss the development of this aspect. It did lead me to believe, at first, that this would be some type of mystery novel. I dont think this novel fits neatly into any genre at all. Not romance, although friendships do develop. Not religious, although Zara often questions the relevance of her Jewish heritage and we do hear about various Christian sects who attempted to convert Jews and Moslems. Perhaps it could be labeled fictionalized history. Im not sure whether Zara was a real personage. Indeed, the bibliography includes an 1866 publication by Elizabeth. But for a history, it doesnt focus heavily on the political personages. It is more a vignette of lives of Europeans during the latter half of the 1800s. And that is just fine with me, Im reading for enjoyment not to spout facts about names, dates, and conflicts.\\nThis review is based on an Advanced Readers Copy. It is remarkably free of typographical and grammatical errorsin fact, I found none, unlike several other ARCs. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Nefertiti is the daughter of a family that's been providing the royal family with brides for generations and now it is her turn to become queen. The Queen Mother hopes that she is strong enough to reign in and control her rebellious and unstable son but the young girl has her own agenda and when she is crowned she becomes unstoppable. \\nGrowing up I liked to look at a metal etching of Nefertiti hanging on the wall of my grandparents' apartment. I never really understood why my grandparents, who didn't appear to be interested in antiquity at all, had that etching but the woman depicted in it was beautiful with her strong profile and an unusual headdress and I just accepted her as a permanent fixture of the living room. A few months ago browsing in a used book shop I saw this book and was immediately transported to my grandparents' living room and picked it up without hesitation. It sat on the shelf since then, waiting its turn, until I finally read it.\\nThe book intrigued me as much as the etching did with its promises of an unusual culture and religion and the people who did something worthy of being immortalized in art. Ms. Moran did a wonderful job of setting the scene and making the story and the characters authentic. From the very first pages Mutnodjmet, the narrator and the sister of Nefertiti, plunges us into that time with references to gods and an account of the latest horrific gossip. It was like listening to a foreigner talk about their land and their culture, a foreigner who just happened to be privy the inner workings of the court of the pharaoh at the time of never before seen change. This very informal tone continued throughout the book and made it an easy and relaxing read. There weren't any explanations of the words and concepts the reader isn't readily familiar with and that kept the narrative from feeling forced. Instead we got a glossary at the end of the book and a genealogical map of the royal family that answered any and all questions that arose. \\nI really enjoyed the seamless blend between fiction and history in this novel. It was such a treat to realize that one of the scenes was about the creation of the legendary bust of Nefertiti that my grandparents' etching is based on. There are a lot of questions about the real Nefertiti and her Pharaoh mainly because the archaeologists haven't been able to find their tombs, or at least definitely identify them as theirs and Ms. Moran gives a plausible explanation of why that is and of why there are hardly any images of the Pharaoh's first wife, Kiya. I can tell that she did a lot of research for this book because her take on the people and the events of the time is very believable. \\nI've seen comparisons of Nefertiti to Philippa Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl and there are plenty of similarities between the stories to support this claim. For example both stories are told by unambitious sisters of incredibly ambitious women who become queens and play crucial roles in the upending of entire countries' way of life. There are some differences though that make these novels dissimilar. For instance, Nefertiti was meant to marry the young pharaoh and Mutny was always just her sister and supporter, not a romantic rival and she was never used by her family the way Mary was. There was also a lot more tragedy in Mutny's life and I sympathized more with her because of it. \\nThe character cast in this book is very multifaceted. There are contrasts of Mutny and Nefertiti and Nefertiti and Kiya, of the two viziers - fathers of the Pharaoh's wives, the Pharaoh himself and his dead brother who was very much of a presence throughout the novel, the two generals opposing the Pharaoh. There are also very warm relationships between Mutny and her servant who becomes her friend and Mutny and the dowager queen Tiye. We don't get much development of Mutny's mother but it's obvious that she loves both her daughters and is a source of comfort to them. \\nI didn't much like Nefertiti because a lot of her actions were very selfish and she appeared to have little or no regard for anyone or anything but herself and her desires but in a way I also admired her for her strength and daring in setting herself apart from any queen who came before her and her patience and determination in working to achieve her dreams. In the end we do learn about some of her redeeming qualities and her character becomes more multi-dimensional but Mutny is a lot more sympathetic because of how honorable and unspoiled she is by her status and living in riches. I chuckled when I read the scene where a chariot driver wanted to give her a ride to the other end of town because she was nobility and she told him off saying that she had two perfectly good legs and could walk. \\nA lot happens during the course of this book, it spans several decades, but it flows very naturally. Never does it become contrived or forced and that made it a very enjoyable read. I look forward to reading Michelle Moran's other books and luckily on the same trip to the book store I picked up The Heretic Queen so that will be easy to arrange. \",\n",

This book's about a girl who is on a job hunt so she can move to New York and make it big. If she can't find a job in 9 months (honestly, 9 MONTHS!), she'll go and teach as a volunteer on a far off island instead. Every chapter describes an attempt at getting a job, but every time she's getting close, she decides it's not what she really wants and blows it. For someone who is apparently desperate, she applies very sparingly (only once every two weeks or month) and doesn't even go for the lowly jobs anyone could get. Thank god, actually, or the book would be even longer...\\nHaving said that, I do have to admit that some parts were pretty good. The audition for a play, the poetry night and the very first interview were pretty funny and did have me laughing out loud. Also, the main character's relation with her boyfriend is somehow very 'real' and just plain cute.\\nMaybe okay for a not too critic beach reader, but I wouldn't recommend it.

       "  'comment': \"*The Hunger Games is about a girl, Katniss Everdeen whos father died in a coal miniing accident 4 years earlier. Her mother nearly lost her mind while her two kids, Katniss 12, and Prim 8 turn to skin and bones. Ever since then, Katniss has been providing for the family. Sneaking out of district 12, hunting the way her father taught her how, trading goods at the black market known as the Hob. Even with Katiss bringing home game every day, there are still nights where her and her family go do bed with an empty stomach. \\n75 years ago, district 13 rebelled against the capitol. The conciquence for that was death to all of district 13, and The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a man made arena by the Capitol. There are 24 tributes in all. 2 from every district, one boy, one girl who have to fight till the death. Katiss and Gale have had to sign up for tessera many years in a row. Tessera is the Capitols way of spliting the districts and dividing the wealthier people from the poor. Your first allowed to sign up for tessera when your 12, the youngest you can be to enter the games. Your name is entered 4 times into the drawings and every year you sign up, the more times your name will be entered. The good thing about haveing tessera is, your family is given a years worth of grain to keep from starving which makes you envy the people that can afford to not enter. \\nThis year the odds are not in Katniss and Gales favor. Gales name will now be entered 42 times into the drawings and Katniss, 23. When Katniss's father died in the mine explosion Gales father was taken along with him and many others. Gale and Katniss both turned to the woods for help and eventually partnered up. They've known each other for 4 years now and katniss puts all her trust in Gale.\\nKatniss has a younger sister Prim who she protects against anything that can hurt her. The one thing Katniss can't protect Prim from tho, is the Capitol. Although Prims name was only put in one time since its her first year, Effie Trinket, the woman that announces the tributes names, just happens to pick hers. Katniss, doing the only thing that made sense to her, volunteers to take Prims place. \\nPeeta was the boy tribute for 12 that was chosen. Katniss met Peeta only once before. The winter her father died Katniss went out to the towns trashcans looking for scraps to take home because she didn't want to go home empty handed and she was to scared to enter the woods. Outside Peeta's family baker shop Katniss was chased away by Peetas mother. Cold, wet and half dead Katniss sat down at the trunk of a tree and was waiting to die when Peeta came out side with a burnt loaf of bread and a swollen, black eye. Without looking her way, Peeta threw the bread towards Katniss and pretended to be feeding the pigs. The bread held katniss and her family until spring and thats when Katniss gained the courage to enter the woods again and gather fruits and vegetables. Without Peets help Katniss and her family would have been dead long before that. \\nLong story short, Katniss and Peetas strategy in the games is to be Star Crossed Lovers. Pretending to be madly in love with each other and appearing to be weak. The Capitol eats it up and Katniss and Peeta gain many sponsors. When Katniss and Peeta are the last two standing, Katniss holds out a handful of poisonous berries and gives half to Peeta to eat. The Game Makers stop them right in time before they swallow and are both crowned victors.\\nWhen i think of the Hunger Games and what the Capitol is making those poor people of Panem do, i sort of think of concentration Camps. The way they are trapped on all sides by electric fences. Instantly killed when trying to escape the districts. The way the Capitol turns everyone against each other. If i were ever in the position to kill someone I loved, I would have done the same thing she had. Killing anyone in general would be horrifying. I couldn't imagine ever leaving the Games the same way I would have went in. Its quite sad how the Capitol does stuff like that. Killing kids that way. Destroying families. Taking away a persons life and viewing it as a source of entertainment. Its crule, and wrong on so many levels. With all of that, it makes the book so intriguing. luring you in with ever word. The strong pain, hatred and love that the book tells, makes you feel all the feelings the characters have.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Normally my reviews list what I loved, what I liked, what I thought was OK, and what I didn't like. This series lends itself to a different type of review! I have read the first 4 that have been released so this review encompasses all of them (so this same review will appear in all 4--have avoided spoilers the best I can)!\\nWhat is worthy of 5 wine glasses (Yummy Goodness): Sara does and says everything that we all wish we would be like if we ever met the man of our fantasies. She is out-spoken, straight forward, and goes for what she wants. She is fun to read and I dare any PNR reader to not identify with her on some level. I mean she references Ash *YUM* (though I am more a Dev girl LOL)! Dray is just the yummy goodness fantasies are made from and yet the thing I think that really wins me over about him is his sweetness (don't laugh-something about a southern gent opening car doors, walking you home is enough to make me go all girly)!\\nWhat is worthy of 4 wine glasses (Teasing Goodness): The moments between these two are H-O-T! I mean fan yourself off hot and there is very little left lacking. I like the humor and the flirtation between these two, it adds a fun sensuality to the mix. That really starts to blossom for me between them in 3 and 4.\\nWhat is worthy of 3 wine glasses (Good but want more): I think the friends in this book are fantastic. I want more of them but since this is Sara/Dray's story, I will survive. They really do add a great layer to the story and just saying the brother, hubba hubba and fun!\\nWhy did I give it a 4: I would recommend this to any PNR reader who can handle the steam (though honestly most can). This is an ADULT novel and highly enjoyable. Great read with a good glass of wine. It is steamy, hot, and raunchy but oh so good at all 3!\\nAuthor Website: http://laurastamps.blogspot.com/ \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'W. and Lars are back for the third and final instalment of Lars Iyers besotted double-act. After Spurious and Dogma, Exodus follows the put upon philosophers on a conference tour of Britain. W. has retained his post at Plymouth University by means of a technicality, though he has been relegated to teaching Sports Science students Badminton Ethics. The much abused Lars persists in his damp, underground flat in Newcastle (though thankfully the rats are gone) but he has just as little hope of surviving the desecration of Humanities faculties, and most regrettably Philosophy departments, across the country. All thats left to them now is despair. Despair and Plymouth Gin.\\nW. and Lars meander across the country and across the (continental) philosophical landscape. W. is ever nostalgic for his postgraduate days at Essex University, though he appears to be the last hanger-on from those days still in academic employment. Will his early experience of life in the wilds of Canada(!) sustain him in the thoughtless wilderness of modern Britain? Is thinking even possible anymore? Or are they all now on the long march from Egypt heading toward a Canaan that W. and Lars will never be able to enter? If so, it is a curious exodus that leads to London and Edinburgh and Oxford and Dundee only to bring them back to Plymouth and one long, last drunken dark night of the soul and dreams of Plymouth Sound glinting like utopia.\\nIts over. Its been a desperate journey across the three novels, full of philosophical musings, sly observations on the state of tertiary education in Britain, exultation of the generative properties of Plymouth Gin, and endless abuse by W. of his erstwhile companion, his Boswell, his inspiration and exasperation, and ultimately his one true friend.

       "  'comment': 'Clear, straightforward, and easy to follow. The premise (that the New Testament contains both deliberate and accidental textual changes) is not very radical if the reader accepts the assertion that the New Testament is rendered by humans, even if divinely inspired. Judging from the reviews available on the web, for some this premise is more outrageous than for others. Ehrman uses interesting examples, such as looking at the form of a section of text to determine which elements are likely to be intrusions. (Those readers who have become familiar with chiasmus through the structure of the Harry Potter series will appreciate the example from Luke.)\\nEhrman assumes that the reader has some knowledge of New Testament criticism--he doesn\\'t talk much about the history of the writing of the Gospels, for example. This may be confusing for people who are not familiar with the writing and redaction of the New Testament. In addition, the \"bible\" of the title is misleading. Ehrman is only addressing the New Testament, not the Torah/Old Testament. \\nI\\'d have wished for Ehrman\\'s recommendation for the best contemporary New Testament available, since I won\\'t be reading it in Greek any time soon.

       "  'comment': 'In this bestselling book, Cahill sets out to show that the world we live in and everything we do and think, is purportedly a result of the Jewish \"revolution\" in history. The concepts expounded in the Bible were a dramatic break from the ancient religions and philosophies, that viewed the world as an endless cycle of birth and death in which human beings had no control over their lives. The Jews broke this way of thinking by defining time as continuous, as moving towards a better future through the decisions of men and women living here and now, in the present. Were it not for the Jews, argues Cahill, the world as we know it would not have come to be; we would have been unable to grasp concepts such as history, future, freedom, faith, hope, individual, justice and pretty much everything else.\\nWhat a wonderful theory and, as a Jew, I\\'m obviously all for it. But unfortunately Cahill devotes most of the book not to providing evidence to support this theory, but rather to a recounting of the major stories of the Bible from his perspective. The few profound points he makes about the contribution of the Jews to the world are lost in the endless quotes from the Bible and in Cahill\\'s somewhat simplistic theories about what really happened. For example, do we really need to know that he believes the Red Sea was a marsh and not a sea, or that the Manna the Israelites ate in the desert was most likely some white plant secretion? Such details are numerous and do not contribute to the main idea offered by the author.\\nCahill does not come through as a particularly believing person and he certainly does not view the Bible as the word of God. Therefore, it is interesting that he uses the following definition for the existence of God:\\n...the Jews developed a whole new way of experiencing reality, the only alternative to all ancient worldviews and all ancient religions. If one is ever to find the finger of God in human affairs, one must find it here. (p. 246)\\nI wonder if Cahill was aware that this very definition was given by Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister of Britain. When asked by Queen Victoria if he can provide proof that God exists, Disraeli (born Jewish himself) thought for a moment and replied: \"The Jews, your Majesty\".\\nAs a believing Jew I particularly liked the way Cahill defines how each and every one of us hears the Voice of God:\\nEach reader must decide if the Voice that spoke to the patriarchs and prophets speaks to him, too. If it does, there is no question of needing proof, any more than we require proof of anyone we believe in... one does not believe that God exists, as one believes that Timbuktu or the constellation Andromeda exists. One believes in God, as one believes in a friend - or one believes nothing.\" (p.250) ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Are you fascinated by pulp novels from many years ago? If so, I recommend this book to you. I bought it at the neighbourhood drug store when I was 12 or 13 years old and read it with spellbound amazement. I live nowhere near the Gulf Coast, and I am not afraid of alligators. Probably because I have never seen a live alligator. The real life experience would probably teach me quite quickly to change my tune.\\nSo what really amazed me was the alligator-hunting team and the other characters in the cast. Just like every society, there are the self-righteous and there are the decadent low-lifes. The biggest mistake one can make is to assume that these groups are mutually exclusive of each other. The fact is that they are not. A good genre author can make people interesting enough to rise above their stereotypes and turn into something more alive. \\nIt's true that this is nowhere near Nobel Prize material, but somehwere I read the quote of a famous author who said that if you really want to find out the most about a society, don't read the high-toned literature of the ivory tower, but rather, read the mundane pulp literature showing a much closer picture of the life of the masses. I better get an exact quote on that, because I am probably way off the mark in that reconstruction, not to mention, totally out of context.\\nI tried to find out more about Shelley Katz, and was successful in tracking down a couple of other titles, but I would recommend this one as a starter in order to try to do a very effective time warp back about 35 years into the past.\\nAs Moby Dick was to Ahab, so the Alligator in this book is to the crew of people eager to find him and kill him.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I loved Vonnegut in high school and then, for reasons I don't in retrospect understand, I classed him among the childish things to put away when I got to college. In the last year or two-- about a decade after college-- I've gone back and read some of the novels I loved in high school. The ones I remember being the best-- Mother Night and Cat's Cradle, e.g.-- are amazing. They're like fascinating and funny clockwork. The individual gears and springs are beautiful in their own right, but when all the pieces come together and function as a whole, it's almost hard to believe.\\nI didn't remember much about Slapstick. Reading it again, all grow'd up, it's easy to see why. If the best Vonnegut novels are functioning watches, Slapstick reads like it was cobbled together from gears and springs found around the shop, then abandoned half-finished.\\nSome of the components are wonderful. Slapstick is the book that develops Vonnegut's idea of artificial families-- family groupings based on shared middle names, assigned at random by a computer. It's a neat idea, and he spells out a few imagined ripple-effects. The book also features a long preface, written in his own voice, that is something special. He gives some history of his family, and writes a bit about the origins of Slapstick. In the preface he mentions writing books with his sister in mind-- she the only member of his audience. I don't know if he talks about this elsewhere in more detail, but his comments on writing with his sister in mind-- both before and after she died-- I've always found wonderful and touching. (Also helpful as a suggestion for writing most anything.)\\nThere are also some problems. The Vonnegut tics-- in this book they're Hi ho and And so on-- don't add any texture to the story. Certainly nothing like the neck-wrenching nihilism of Slaughterhouse 5's So it goes. In Slapstick, they're just tics. There are ideas thrown in but not developed. Variable gravity and miniaturized Chinese. These ideas are structurally integrated in a way that makes them seem like they're supposed to be important. But if they serve any purpose of plot, theme, or metaphor, I failed to notice. The book stops abruptly, without resolution. (There's a comment, at the end, about how it is fitting to stop, here, at the climax of the main character's life. But, given the events of the book, no one could take such a claim seriously.) It's almost as if Vonnegut decided to cut his losses after realizing the novel wasn't going to work out.\\nBroken watches are still fun to look at. Page by page, Slapstick is fun, too. It's got the usual mix of funny and sad, thought-provoking passages mixed with crude humor. Just don't go in mistaking it for a functioning novel. \",\n",

Home-schooled for the first half of her life she comes to Mica High and captivates Leo an 11th-grader , and leaves the entire school enchanted.. This book definitely captivated me as well. Although her individuality first sparks interest, this interest quickly turns into disdain when they can't label her. Stargirl brings up issues that teens can relate to such as: individuality, conformity, bullying, popularity, and the need to be accepted. Although this book can seem like fantasy as times this book is realistic as teens go through many issues of insecurity while in high school. I took this book as an anthem to those who march to the beat of their own ukulele. Enchanting and heartbreaking, you might recall someone in your life that resembles this teen, or those who shun the qualities that make her stand out.

Eric, at only 15 years old has never experienced the feelings that he has developed for the mesmerizing green-eyed, flaming red haired beauty that is strikingly different from anyone hes ever met before. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Eric knows that his adoration for Susan surpasses everything else and agrees to marry her. For Susan, a young witch, this is the beginning of a prophesy that will potentially change the entire world and this binding is worth the sacrifices that will be made before she is able to spend a lifetime with her soul mate. For Eric, his naive agreement to Susans terms will test his strength and ultimately draw him into the mysterious world of The Three Circles. \\nRickey Bray did an outstanding job at captivating his audience in this well written fantasy. The story line will consume your thoughts well after youve put the book down. The beginning of the book starts out a little slow and is quite confusing. I urge you to continue reading. Soon everything falls into place and the words and sentences flow easily. Mr. Bray uses such immaculate vocabulary that I think some may be intimidated upon initial inspection of this book. However, heed my advice when I say that once youve read a few chapters, youll feel completely at ease and the verse will marry with the story and create a perfect symmetry. \\nI would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates an involved plot, such as myself. Rickey Bray certainly does not skimp on the details, which makes for a rather long, but well written read. Anyone who likes romance entwined with paranormal fiction is going to love this story as well. Also those interested in witches, fantasy and sci-fi should get a copy of Rendezvous Rock immediately. \\nI can easily say that Rendezvous Rock is one of my favorite reads to date and thats saying a lot. I was so spellbound by this book that I had a hard time putting it down. After I did put it down, the story and characters would still course through my brain. This is not a book that you will soon forget. The storyline is lingering. I cant say enough about this book to do it justice. While the story ends entirely and leaves you with a sense of closure, I beg for the story to continue!

       "  'comment': 'When I requested A Short History of Women through LTER, it looked promising. Interesting subject, generational womens story, changing voice, social history - all right up my alley. I had tried to read one of Kate Walberts earlier books, Our Kind, but couldnt get through it but that couldve been a fluke and maybe this book would lead me back there. Oh well. \\nIn looking through my notes, Im not even sure what to say about it. Uneven comes to mind. The story begins in 1914 England with a suffragette starving herself for the cause and continues through subsequent generations of female family members. The story moves back and forth through time and characters, explaining actions and reactions. Truly, I liked it and I didnt like it. There were chapters I loved and others I hated, where I just couldnt seem to catch the rhythm. Three quarters of the way through, I began to lose patience and just wanted to finish it and move on. \\nI hate to be so wishy-washy, but I may have enjoyed this more at a different time. Sadly, somewhere lost in this book was a story I really would have enjoyed reading had the author not been trying quite so hard. A more patient reader may find it to be more worthwhile. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Edward Lee was recommended to me by someone I met on goodreads. Our library only had two or three to choose from. And I have to say that if The Black Train is a true representation of Lee's writing I won't be reading any more of his books. It started slow and never really picked up. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. The end was a disappointment and fairly predictable. The middle was full of simplistic writing and a strange choice of words in at least one case. The sex wasn't sexy enough, the horror wasn't very horrific. I'm still trying to decide if I want to try one more of his books or not. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"While this book had all the elements that I loved in the previous two books (satire, allegory, poetic description), it was really lacking the cohesion of the other two and was generally a disappointing end to the Space Trilogy 3 Book Set Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra &amp; That Hideous Strength C.S. Lewis. Lewis seems very caught up in the politics of academia for the first third of the book, and then suddenly remembers the fantasy genre. The last third of the book features a rather anti-climactic battle that seemed to be a pastiche of several different mythologies.\\nAll that said, there is still a lot of value in the book. There are some deftly drawn characters unlike anything I've read in other literature of the 1940s. Lewis' investigation of the complexities of marriage, while it does not go far enough, asks important questions that blend faith and sociology in provocative ways.\\nIf you have read Out of the Silent Planet (Space Trilogy, Book One) and Perelandra (Space Trilogy, Book 2) I would recommend that you finish the trilogy, if for no other reason than plot continuity. I will say that this book does not stand alone as one of Lewis' better works. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Like the first volume in this series, this is a black and white American manga graphic novel by Tokyopop. Im not sure if it would make all that much sense if you hadnt read the first volume because the setting and premise are pretty outlandish, so I would suggest starting with the first book in the series.\\nNote: This review features mild plot spoilers -- read at your own risk.\\nThe premise of Volume 2 is virtually the same as that of the first: its Halloween (presumably a year after the first book) and the sociopathic gang of kids is setting out to begin trick or treating. It shares a similar tone with the first volume in the series, though a few characters are missing (e.g., Pig Pig) or not dealt with and there are a few new characters added (including one little fat girl who has the bad luck to be slowly  over the course of the book  eaten by one of her zombified sisters). The setting is the same archetypal small town where the kids live, with one exception: there seems that a horde of zombies have invaded the town, destroying whatever thin veneer of civilization that once ordered the town. Not to worry, the zombies are extremely slow and mindless, and while they are everywhere, the kids arent deterred from going trick or treating on Halloween. Never fear, though, as Moochie (Finchs maniacal little sister) has a hilarious plan to save the town from the zombies that involves a butcher knife and the zombies pootie parts.\\nTheres a third volume of I Luv Halloween available, though I havent read it. I do plan to pick up the omnibus edition of the three volumes at some point  I Luv Halloween Ultimate Twisted Edition (Cabbage Poot)  because its in hardcover, in color, in a larger sized edition than the individual volumes, and it includes an extra ten-page epilogue, so it seems like an all-around great deal.\\nThe story ends with a bang (literally). Id recommend it if you enjoyed the first volume of the series. If you couldnt deal with the original mixture of slapstick comedy and Halloween-themed gore, then you definitely dont want to read this. If anything, its even gorier, since almost everyone ends up getting chomped and pulled apart by zombies. It was a lot of fun, but somehow just not quite as charming as the first volume. I give this second volume 4 stars out of 5.\\nReview copyright 2010 J. Andrew Byers ',\n",

When Alvin left for Tennessee because he fell in love with a girl, Joe found himself in a sort of holding pattern involving playing a lot of poker and eating at McDonalds every day. Suddenly, Alvin returns with a suitcase full of money and a plan to buy a yacht and sail around the world. Then Alvin disappears again, but Julia (the girl Alvin went to Tennessee for) shows up looking for him. Somehow, the end result of all of this is that Joe ends up going back to Tennessee with Julia and getting a job as a pool boy at one of her family\\'s hotels. What happened to Alvin -- did he buy a boat and sail away? Go into hiding? Is he dead?\\nJoe has some sort of unspecified developmental disorder. The book\\'s cover blurb, \"Maybe Joe can\\'t grow up -- but he can love\" inevitably brings Forrest Gump to mind (\"I may not be a smart man...\"). He\\'s caught up in an entire cast full of shady characters, making him pretty much the only likeable character in the book (well, Julia is at least occasionally likeable).

       "  'comment': 'A must-read. In a strictly literal sense: everybody should read this book.\\nIt\\'s funny, and then it\\'s funny and it\\'s tragic, and then it\\'s just tragic, and then finally it\\'s triumphant, and the extraordinary thing is how Heller manages to keep the events he\\'s describing largely unchanged while he takes us through the emotional wringer.\\nThe source of both the comedy and the tragedy is the implacable insanity of war; not the fact of war itself, but the way in which the war is conducted. The \"Catch-22\" of the title is a regulation that captures in miniature the unfeeling bureaucratic system that\\'s needed to send ordinary sensible folk out to kill other folk and to die. It goes like this: to be sent home, all a pilot needs is to be declared insane, and to request a transfer on medical grounds. But requesting a transfer out of the war zone is evidence that the pilot is concerned for his own safety; this, in turn, is considered sufficient evidence of sanity, so his diagnosis will be overturned.\\nThe same structure turns up again and again. At first it\\'s hilarious, as we see basically sensible and good-hearted characters trying to keep their lives going despite the insanity of their situation. Then while the same jokey situations keep coming up, the mood turns tragic as we realise that that very insanity can hurt and kill the characters we\\'ve learned to like, and that there is nothing they can do to fight back.\\nI won\\'t spoil the ending, but I\\'ll say that the downward movement does get turned around. Even knowing how this happens, the moment that it hits still leaves me with tears prickling in my eyes. That\\'s a pretty high achievement, given that the first half of the novel is basically pure comedy.\\nRead it. ',\n",

They were married when Cassie was disowned by her father after finding out she was pregnant from a summer fling at the young age of 18. For 15 years Cassie has felt isolated and neglected in the swampy coastal South Carolina low country, the victim to her husband\\'s demanding job and closed up personality. Now she has run off to start a new life, taking their very angry teen aged daughter with her. But being without Peck leaves her feeling even more unsettled and confused. Can their marriage be saved?\\nThis is 300 pages of mostly introspective writing. The characters are flawed in both believable and unbelievable ways. I could never tell if I thought they were genuine or not. And I kept waiting for action but it never really delivered. Even the big action scene near the end wasn\\'t action-packed. There were some \"spiritual\" elements that were open for interpretation. Was it supernatural interference or just coincidence? And the ending was a bit difficult for me to swallow. Near the end is the area filled with the most unbelievable elements but I can\\'t give an example without giving away a major spoiler.\\nThe book was a good example of location as a character. Though I have never been to the East Coast I could picture both the marshes and the mountains. Also, I think the way the chapters move back and forth between Peck and Cassie were an effective way of telling their story, getting both perspectives and seeing both of their vulnerable sides. I liked Peck, and I thought the daughter, Kelly, had spunk. She needed more discipline but you could understand her anger. To be fair, her parents weren\\'t acting any better.\\nBut to get back to the point, did I actually like it? I did, I think. Despite all of its little flaws it did feel like it could have happened, mostly. Would I recommend it? Probably only to those who, like me, love a character driven novel. Unfortunately, I\\'m afraid most people aren\\'t going to stick with it long enough to get to know the characters and care what happens to them. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"*mild spoiler ahead*\\nA little boy disappears on a foggy day on the Swedish island of land. This book unravels the story of what has happened to him. We find out, but the solution to the mystery differs from our expectations.\\nI must agree with one of the other reviewers: the characters do have their flaws in the book. With that I don't mean real life flaws, but artificial flaws. In particular Gerlof and his friends are sometimes depicted as stupid secret wannabe detectives, even to their relatives.\\nNils Kant, the sociopath, however, is well depicted.\\nWhat enamored me was the personal change Julia went through. For her returning and searching for the fate of her boy turns out to be a spiritual journey towards acceptance, healing and - I hate to say - maturity. She is able to find redemption at the end of the book.\\nA few times Theorin tries to rev up the suspension by switching story lines. That's nothing new, but in this book he uses this in the wrong way. He switches twice from a dramatic occurrence to a boring description of something hardly interesting for the development of the story. \\nThe end of the story is mildly surprising as to why the boy disappeared. In these cases the revelations often follow too hasty. That's no problem for a fast paced book, but This book isn't, so unraveling the truth should follow the same pace.\\nEngrossing, nevertheless, and great depiction of the isolation of land and desolation of the alvar. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this book yet. I do know it's going to stay with me for a long time. It's narrated (for the most part) by Oskar Schell, a precocious little boy who lost his father in the 9/11 attacks. The book is heartrending and still, somehow, beautiful. There is such love and such pain in this boy's life and in the lives of his mother and grandparents.\\nThe author experiments with the format of the novel too. This one has first-person narrative, letters, pictures, drawings, phone calls, and probably other things I'm leaving out. So, it's interesting in that respect. And in some instances, I think more powerful. Other times, I'm not so sure the experimentation was successful.\\nThere is a remarkable similarity between a couple of the characters and their backstory in this book and in Nicole Krauss's The History of Love, a book I truly loved. Krauss and Foer swear they don't work together and that the similarities are coincidental. I think that's probably true. But I think they probably share a family story or other source material that they both found fascinating enough to explore in their own work. The similarities certainly didn't detract from my enjoyment of either novel. (If enjoyment is the right word for something as emotionally distressing as Oskar's story.)\\nFor what my opinion is worth, I thought this book was better than Everything Is Illuminated (though I liked that one too), but not as good as Krauss's The History of Love. Is it fair for me to compare his writing to hers? Maybe not, but I'm going to anyway.\\nI think I'd recommend this book, but I'd be hesitant. It might be too painful for someone who lost someone on 9/11. I just don't know. \",\n",

The story here relates to Nazi Germany\\'s cruiser war - the use of its surface ships as commerce raiders against Allied shipping and convoys in the Atlantic, particularly. Well written and easy to read, Reeman\\'s fiction can perhaps be faulted for complicating his well-described naval actions with somewhat less well etched character development among members of his supporting cast (as compared to his much better presented leading characters).

Well, get thee hence and do it, otherwise this book will not make any sense at all. There. You've seen it? Good.\\nRight, so after watching the Compleat Works, you now need to read the Compleat Guide to Shakespeare: his life, his works, his movies. And in this hysterical (yet surprisingly informative) guide, you will be treated to one of the most irreverent biographies and literary criticisms you've ever read. They include a short criticism of every play, and then go through movie versions and tell you which versions they think are the most notable (if any exist at all), rating each on a scale of 0 to 5 bards. In the movies section, they also include those movies that are somewhat loosely based on Shakespeare's plays, such as 10 Things I Hate About You. They're not afraid to tell it like they see it, and I was somewhat gratified to see that they disliked (one and two bards, respectively)the same two versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream that I detested in college. In fact, the movie section is worth the price of the book, and I'm holding onto my library copy a little longer so I can make a note of the ones I want to see. \",\n",

Everything from the light to the darkest dark comes to life as the Fates weave their tapestry. It had me pondering whether or not I may have bitten off more than I could chew.\\nCera, our leading lady, begins life in a most ordinary way, but its ended very suddenly leaving her in spirit form to continue on her journeyand although she doesnt know it, carry out a prophesized upheaval within Deaths Dream Kingdom. Its a task shes not prepared for but one that in time will come as naturally to her as breathing albeit much harder thanks to events yet to unfold. One of those events is her meeting the ruler of this purgatory-type kingdom, Dismis. Lets just say this is one fellow (or whatever he was/is) that you DO NOT want to tangle with. Second meeting to note is her introduction to Adewyn. Though she doesnt know it (yet), hes the love of her life and the connection fostered between them is irrepressiblethe stuff legends are made of. \\nAnother character whose name will cause you a curious grinSin. Sins character is hard to puzzle out as her allegiances are murky at best. One moment she seems friend, next your instincts are screaming foe.the truth is uncovered over the course of the story though, leading to a fitting end and a well of respect for the hardships endured. One of my favorite appearances was the presence of the Fates as Ive always found their lore most intriguingcomplex and a bit scary, yesbut intriguing nonetheless. To summarize, the characters are a mix of myth, legend, and religion all blended together to make one heck of a brew.\\nA brief \"warning\" or two just to touch on quickly. First up, language. The few sensual scenes are chaste enough, but the language? Oye, my head! Its no Trespass and most of it is sporadicduring the first half. The second half, to put it somewhat bluntly, just because one is talking with a demon or happens to be one, does not mean you have to call someone vulgar names multiple times in ONE conversation. \\nSecond item on the table for discussion is sentence structure. A large portion of the text had me wincing to some degree because of the continual use of short sentences. Its a bit too step by step and breaks up the flow of the story for the reader. Again, purely my opinion, and obviously neither point was so strong that I had to stop reading.\\nLast but not least, something that either gets too much discussion or not enoughthe cover image; beautiful is it not? At first glance, I merely saw the young woman at the top looking up (back?) to the heavens for whatI wasnt certain.and the predominantly red cover. As with most books, there was careful planning when this particular combination was decided upon and after completing my journey through the story, I can now see how they fit together. Did you catch the graveyard in the back image there? How about the expansive river? Each is a piece of the overall puzzle that when finally revealed, brings things to a natural order.\\nAll in all, though I began the book perplexed as to how much I would enjoy the story, in the endI felt satisfied with the journey taken. Its a beautiful world that author Jessica Penot has created, though not always in the conventional sense of the word. The paths shes given her characters are riddled with choices and believe you me, there is a right option and a wrong option even if its not always clear. A picture perfect masterpiece? Depends on your point of view.but from where Im sitting, its certainly a book worth your notice. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I am normally not the one to pick up young adult literature, but What I Saw peaked my interest since it was such a departure from Judy Blundell's famous series. (She penned the Star Wars books under her pen name, Jude Watson)\\nIt is hard to sum up What I Saw without giving away the whole book, but here is a purposely vague outline. Set in 1947, What I Saw is narrated by Evie Spooner, an awkward 15-year old, living with her mother, Beverly, and recently-returned-from-war stepfather, Joe. Joe Spooner is a soldier turned businessman who married Beverly despite his mother's advice; Beverly Spooner was only too happy to find some stability after raising Evie on her own. As for Evie, she languishes in the shade of her mother's gorgeous looks, and yearns to grow up despite Beverly's attempts to keep her as a child for as long as possible. Am impromptu trip to Florida seems like the ideal family vacation, until unexpected events disrupt their lives and change them forever. Hidden discontents are brought to light, secrets uncovered, betrayals recognized and Evie is propelled into adulthood by the lies around her.\\nWhat surprised me about What I Saw was how much meaning Judy Blundell was able to pack into this quick read. She masterfully created the 1940's setting - from the prejudices and the notions about the right vs wrong behavior, to the full-skirted dresses cinched at the waist. Blundell also excelled at getting across Evie's longing - for love, for acceptance, for being treated as an equal - and her strong resolve when her world comes crashing around her. And of course, it's the suspense that kept me reading into the wee hours of the night. Each sentence felt like a glimpse of the final outcome, but not quiet, and kept me wondering how the story would turn out. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'I\\'m usually not one for short stories, yet I keep requesting the collections of them. However, Into the Woods was a pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed each story, and this collection is a must-have for the millions of Kim Harrison fans out there! These stories will grab you and not let you go! There are some new and some old stories in here, and while you may have read some of them, you haven\\'t read them all. Also, not all of these are Hollows stories, and it\\'s nice to see Harrison branch out and create other worlds. You won\\'t want to miss this anthology.\\nMy favorite story was \"Ley Line Drifter,\" mainly because I love Jenks so much. I really enjoyed getting to see Jenks and Matalina interact. It added a whole new level to the series for me. I also enjoyed \"Million Dollar Baby,\" even though it also crushed my hopes a bit. I enjoyed seeing things from Trent\\'s perspective, and I adored his interactions with Jenks. As far as the non-Hollows stories, I think I liked \"Pet Shop Boys\" the best, and not just because it reminds me of the band. I really liked learning about new vampires. These guys were extremely interesting, and I\\'d love to see her write at least one full-length novel about them. \\nOverall, I\\'d recommend this to all Kim Harrison fans. I really believe there is something for everybody in this collection. I enjoyed each of the stories, and I hope to see Harrison branch out further into some of these new worlds in the future. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I feel unaccountably annoyed after finishing this book. Sydney Sage is (mostly) an awesomely nerdy girl hero, full of grace and sass and wit. Knowledge is power, ladies and young ladies! The issue hinted at in book one - our otherwise smart girl has an eating disorder - is dealt with subtly and well in this installment, and I do love YA novels that are willing to tackle body image issues in a positive way. \\nBut. The romantic melodrama at the heart of the story, while probably very appealing to teen girls, is starting to feel pretty formulaic, like Mead has some sort of Mad Lib style template into which she plugs names and adjectives to produce her emo scenes of sexual tension. They're all starting to run together for me. They just seem so hollow. \\nBECAUSE, and I think I've said this every time, Mead COULD clearly write a good book. A really good book. MAYBE A GREAT BOOK, YOU NEVER KNOW. Just take a quick gander at Malachai Wolfe, minor character, who steals the show with his improbable tale of battling a rabid moose. Or the small, sudden bits of near-poetry her dialogue achieves. So, so frustrating. Not living up to her potential, I would say, if I had a parent teacher conference with her parents. And yes, I believe that the young adult genre, even the vampire young adult genre, is a field in which greatness can be achieved. \\nOn the other hand, greatness is rarely profitable, and she's probably laughing all the way to the bank, fanning herself with a fan made of dollar bills. What do I know. \\nI'll admit, though, I have this crazy but persistent fantasy of getting all her books, adult and YA, together and cutting out all the boring, repetitive sexy scenes. Maybe getting rid of most of the main characters. I'd sew the rest back together, a new epic made of her backup characters and one-liners, a story of lonesome angels and seedy demons and one-eyed moose fighters and disheveled witches and nerds. It'd be a thing of beauty. \\n\\n \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The full title for this work is <b> \"For Luncheon and Supper Guests: Ten Menus: More than One Hundred Recipes, Suitable for Company Luncheons, Sunday Night Suppers, Afternoon Parties, Automobile Picnics, Evening Spreads, and for Tea Rooms, Lunch Rooms, Coffee Shops, and Motor Inns\".</b>\\nI give you this because I think it provides a better idea of what this book encompasses than just the short title. \\nBACKGROUND:::\\nNow as for the author, when I first ran across this book my thought was who is Alice Bradley and why should I bring her into my kitchen. I couldn\\'t find much but what I pieced together was that Alice Bradley was staff at Ms. Farmer\\'s School of Cookery. As such she wrote books, pamphlets, and articles for magazines such as \"The Journal of Home Economics\". \\nThis particular book was published in 1922 by Whitcomb &amp; Barrows, Boston. My take on it is that Ms. Bradley wrote this for the \\'new modern woman\\' who no longer had the staff at home to produce those big Victorian, multi-course meals. And, in fact, she writes:\\n\"Meals of many courses are neither practical nor popular with the modern hostess. For a company luncheon or supper it is not necessary to serve more than a hot dish, a salad, a biscuit or sandwich, a dessert and a beverage. A first course and a relish may be provided if desired.\"\\nINSIDE:::\\nWhat you find inside Ms. Bradley\\'s book are the \\'over 100 recipes\\' divided into 10 Menus, which you could, of course mix and match. Here are 3 sample Menu\\'s.\\nMENU I\\nFruit Cup\\nHot Ham Sandwich\\nCurrant or Grape Jelly\\nTomato Salad with Cheese Dressing\\nCocoa Ice Cream\\nFig Marguerites\\nTea with Candied Mint Leaves\\nMENU II\\nGrapefruit Baskets with Mints\\nOpen Cheese and Bacon Sandwich\\nMixed Sweet Pickles\\nCrab Meat and Tomato Jelly Salad\\nEgg Biscuits\\nOrange Layer Cake\\nIced Coffee with Vanilla\\nMENU X\\nCream of Mushroom Soup\\nTuna Fish  la King in Patty Cases\\nCabbage and Carrot Salad\\nThousand Island French Dressing\\nBran Muffins\\nMaple Charlotte with Maple Pecan Sauce\\nand Sponge Cake\\nCoffee with Honey and Whipped Cream\\nFor the curious, here are two sample recipes.\\nLITTLE CHOCOLATE CAKES\\nPut in double boiler\\n2 squares chocolate, broken in small pieces\\n cup milk and\\n2 egg yolks.\\nCook, stirring constantly until thick and smooth. Remove from fire and add\\n1 cup sugar and\\n3 tablespoons butter and\\n1  cups bread flour, alternately with\\n cup milk in which\\n teaspoon soda is dissolved.\\nBeat well and fold in\\n2 egg whites beaten stiff and\\n teaspoon vanilla.\\nPour into greased individual tins and bake 15 minutes at 450 degrees F. Cover with Cream frosting in different colors.\\nCREAM FROSTING\\nBeat\\n1 egg white until stiff, add\\n2 teaspoons cream\\n teaspoon vanilla and, slowly,\\n cup confectioners\\' sugar, and more if needed to make of right consistency to spread.\\nDivide into several portions, and color with a bit of Color paste, pale yellow, pink, green, or lavender.\\nAs you can see the directions are sparse. And as yet, I haven\\'t tested any, though the above will probably be the first I do try out on family.\\nTHOUGHTS:::\\nNow, considering this book can be gotten free for the Kindle, and at Gutenberg, I don\\'t see where you can go wrong with downloading the book and reading these recipes. \\nMyself, I\\'m also reading... and re-reading this book just to see what sorts of foods and beverages were being consumed in the 20\\'s. The fact that I might find some delicious chocolate treat therein doesn\\'t motivate me in any way.\\nThere are some line drawings in this book which won\\'t, of course, be available to those reading it on the Kindle. HOWEVER, unlike other cases, it doesn\\'t really matter with this particular book that the sketches are missing because the drawings don\\'t show \\'processes\\', but only present a very vague idea of what the final product might look like. \\nPam T~\\npageinhistory ',\n",

Historien om hennes liv fortelles til datteren Paula. \\nIsabel Allende er usedvanlig pen og rlig i denne boka, og byr virkelig p seg selv. Vi fr kjennskap til vanskelighetene hun og mannen Willie har hatt i sitt ekteskap, spesielt i de frste rene. Videre forteller hun om sin innblanding i barnas liv, og tegner et bilde av en svigermor fra helvete. En svigermor som lste seg inn i sine barns hjem i tide og utide. Hennes kjrlighet til barna og barnebarna er s altoppslukende at hun ikke kunne la vre. Samtidig viser hun at hun er i stand til  ta korrektiver. \\nVi flger ogs Isabel Allende gjennom hennes forfatterskap, og fr i s mte innblikk i hvorfor forfatterskapet hennes tidvis har vaklet som en flge av skrivesperre og mangel p ideer. \\nDette er en avslrende bok om det  bli gammel og ikke takle det, om et levd liv med lidenskap og kjrlighet i fokus, om sterke familiebnd og en usvikelig lojalitet familiemedlemmene i mellom. \\nJeg koste meg med boka, selv om den tidvis haltet noe.

       "  'comment': 'You may also read my review here: http://www.mybookishways.com/2011/11/review-before-the-fall-a-dark-breed-novella...\\nIm a huge fan of this series (see my Ascension review),and the upcoming 2nd novel,Bedeviled,is just as good (review to come),so when I got a chance to review the newest novella,I was eager to dive back into the world of the Dark Breed and the Order. Its less than 6 hours until the gates of Hell open up,unleashing all matter of beasties and supernatural nastiness on to an unsuspecting public. Zach,who left the Order of Ancients 10 years ago after a Lychen injury almost killed him,is called back to action,but he doesnt plan on getting anywhere without the woman he loves,Key West cop Shanna. They broke up a while back after Zach confided in her what he used to do for the Order,and her disbelief and refusal to trust him broke his heart. He refuses to leave her to a fate worse than death,and has to kidnap her and show her what lurks beneath to convince him that they must run for their lives. During their journey to St. Augustine,and the relative safety of the Order,Zach realizes that hes still very much in love with Shanna,and she realizes that her love for Zach never really died either. She proves to be a strong ally and when the gates begin to open,theyll have to battle some baddies before they can fall safely in one anothers arms.\\nBefore the Fall is a short,quick read at about 100 pages,and you certainly wont regret your time spent with it. As usual,the authors create a fun world filled with diabolical creatures,and the pacing is lightening fast as our heroes race against time. If you havent discovered the Dark Breed series yet,this is a great primer,and will certainly whet your appetite for the awesome world that Sable Grace has created! ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Sometimes it seems as if Ive been reading political humorist P.J. ORourke forever, so when I spotted Holidays in Heck in the new books section of my local library a few days ago I grabbed it. This one bills itself as the follow-up to the classic Holidays in Hell -a 1989 book I thoroughly enjoyed - the premise being that ORourke, this time around, will tell us about some of his family vacations in place of describing the hellhole war zone days of his prior life. (ORourke swore off war zones after the Iraq war.)\\nHolidays in Heck is written pretty much in the expected P.J. ORourke style, but his observations do not seem to have quite the bite of his earlier work (even though the book is largely rewritten from articles published as early as 2003 in magazines such as Forbes, The Weekly Standard, and World Affairs). Perhaps this is because of the nature of the subject matter, or because ORourke places less emphasis on politics this time than he usually does, but this one reads as a tamer version of his earlier writing style.\\nThe book, for some reason, chooses to open with what I found to be its weakest chapter, one called Republicans Evolving in which ORourke describes a 2003 trip taken to the Galapagos Islands with some of his Republican friends. Largely one-joke repeated too many times to be funny ( as his Republican friends first concern always seems to be the edibility of every creature they observe on the islands), this chapter is thankfully not representative of those that follow. Subsequent chapters find ORourke, sometimes with his entire family in tow, visiting places such as the National World War II monument in Washington D.C., Brays Island Plantation in South Carolina, China, the mountains of Kyrgyzstan, Hong Kong, Disneyland, or Afghanistan. Along the way, he even manages to go skiing in Ohio (who knew?), riding to the hounds in England, and convinces his family to vacation at home one year.\\nHolidays in Heck is an interesting travelogue, and much of what ORourke had to say as he passed through various layers of heck made me smile. Surprisingly, I began to look forward to the observations of ORourkes two little girls, Muffin and her younger sister Poppet, as their father wryly reported on their innocent world view. Seeing a bit of the world through the fresh eyes of children is never a bad thing.\\nRated at: 3.0 ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"I have found that Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware mysteries are like popcorn -- highly addictive, but not terribly nutritious. I have read almost every book in the ongoing saga of Dr. Delaware, a wealthy and semi-retired child psychologist, and seen, in the process, Kellerman's authorial skills grow substantially.\\nHis earliest books are crammed with tortured literary metaphors, often jarringly inappropriate and distracting. All of his characters tended to speak with the same voice -- an irritating flaw, like the hoarse monotones of the characters in the NYPD BLUE TV series. Kellerman's characters in the Alex Delaware books all speak in short, choppy sentences, with little emotional inflection. And it has been justly noted that Kellerman seems to pay as much attention to how his characters dress as to his plots -- the over-abundance of detail weighs down many of his books.\\nBut COMPULSION was a welcome surprise. Kellerman's writing was tauter, his characters more individually drawn, and there was a welcome dearth of tortured metaphors. The plot zipped along, with fewer conspiratorial red-herrings than some of his earlier books.\\nI found the story so gripping that I literally finished it in one sitting, and when I put down the book, I had the internal glow of having read something worthwhile, interesting, and satisfyingly filling.\\nHighly recommended, particularly to Kellerman's legion of fans. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Okay, Mitch is now my *new* favorite Kowalski. It probably didn't hurt that I absolutely loved the small part he played in his brother Sean's book (Yours to Keep), but somehow in his own book I loved him even more! I don't know how Shannon Stacey does it, but each book in this series seems to be even better than the last. The banter is fun, and I had quite a few laugh out loud moments. Both Paige and Mitch really felt like real people, and the Kowalski family dynamic is great. Stacey clearly sets up Mitch and Sean's siblings for books, and I can't wait to read them!\\nThe only (small) issue I had with this book (and with the one before it as well) is that the over-involvement of the parental figure characters (Emma's grandmother and Mrs. Kowalski in Sean's book; Rosie the housekeeper in this one) feels a bit forced. Maybe it's just that I don't have that same type of person in my own life, but their influence on the plot seems heavy-handed. One other not-quite criticism: I would have loved for this book to be longer; 70,000 words went by much too quickly! All in all, I can't wait for book five in the series. Hurry up, November:) \",\n",

       "  'comment': '<b>Summary:</b> The premise of Y: The Last Man is simple... what would happen in a world without men? In this case, every man (and every Y-chromosome-bearing male mammal) on the planet was simultaneously and instantly killed by a mysterious plague. Every man, that is, except one: Yorrick Brown. (And his pet capuchin monkey Ampersand.) After the disaster, all he wants to do is travel to Australia to find his girlfriend, but instead he must travel from Washington D.C. to Boston, avoiding gangs of violent women eager to destroy any trace of the patriarchy, and attempt to find a doctor who might hold the key to why Yorrick is the only male to have survived the plague.\\n<b>Review:</b> Y: The Last Man is I think one of the modern classics of the graphic novel format. It\\'s probably the first graphic novel series I remember hearing about in the days before I started reading them for myself, and now that I\\'m finally getting around to it, I\\'m pleased to report that at least the first volume totally lives up to the hype. \\nI do love me a well-thought-out post-apocalyptic world, and the world of Y: The Last Man is incredibly intriguing. I love thinking through the ramifications of the premise - what *would* happen if all of the men died tomorrow? - and I especially love when the writers come up with angles that never would have occurred to me (i.e. the majority of the remaining U.S. politicians would be Democrats.) There\\'s also a fair amount of science behind this science fiction, and since sex determination is an area of particular interest to me, I\\'ve also been having fun trying to think through the virology/epidemiology/endocrinology/genetics of the plague. (Why only mammalian males? What about fish or frogs with an X chromosome? What about XY-but-androgen-insensitive women? What would the world look like if, within a generation, all of the mammals really did die out for lack of males?)\\nIt\\'s still a little bit of the early stages to have formed much of an opinion on the characters yet, but the plot is interesting enough, and going in enough different directions that I\\'ve been thoroughly sucked in. Neither the artwork or the panelling is particularly unique or phenomenally noteworthy, although the style *is* right up my alley - slightly simplified, with strong, un-sketchy lines. (The style is actually visually pretty similar to Fables.) Squeamish readers, though, be warned: there is a fair bit of extremely graphic violence and some strong and sexually-charged language. Not enough to put me off, but definitely more than I was expecting. There are also a few characters I can\\'t always tell apart yet, but again: early days. I\\'m definitely going to keep reading, since I\\'m dying to see where the story goes from here. 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\n<b>Recommendation:</b> Fans of apocalyptic or dystopian sci-fi should definitely read this, if they haven\\'t already. Also good for biology nerds, readers of Anne Rice\\'s The Queen of the Damned who think Akasha should have just gotten her way, and anyone who\\'s ever uttered (or heard) the phrase \"Not if you were the last man on Earth.\" ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"This is a riveting novel about a young woman caught in a web of destructive circumstances. Beginning in 1913 and ending in 1927 it covers the life of Julia Almond. The reader first encounters Julia at age fifteen when she is a pretty, bright and charming student at a London girls' school. Even though she has ability and personality, Julia's future is not promising. Her parents are lower middle class. Her father works as a clerk for a real estate agency and makes just enough money to support his family in a modest home and her mother keeps the house. There was never quite enough money to put something aside for a rainy day or for Julia's continued education. After school Julia is apprenticed to a boutique dress shop where she learns the ins and out of dress design and finds she has a talent for business management. She is sent to Paris as a buyer for the boutique, makes friends with a young actress who gives her an in with the theater crowd. Life is good and getting better.\\nThen a calamity occurs when Julia's father dies and leaves his family almost destitute. In short order Julia's home is invaded by her uncle, aunt and young cousin to help meet expenses. She must share a room with a ten year old and her mother is reduced to almost servant status in her own home. To escape, Julia marries her father's friend, a 35 year old widower who offers her a lovely house and expects a dutiful, grateful wife. As the years pass, Julia struggles to maintain her individuality. She refuses to give up her career, does not want children, and longs for Prince Charming to come and sweep her away to a life of passion and adventure. He shows up when Julia is 26, a young sailor engaged to her 17 year old cousin. He is handsome, not dull, and, even though only 20, he gives off the air of a man of the world. She and Leo fall passionately in love. As they become involved with each other Julia becomes more and more disgusted with her husband. He is becoming fat, has a dull brain, and insists on a husband's rights which he executes with no care or skill. In letters to her young lover, Julia begins to fantasize about being free to marry Leo. If she cannot get a divorce, maybe her husband will oblige by dying.\\n And so the novel becomes something more than a look at a pretty, imaginative, selfish and sometimes silly woman who, only twenty years later, would have been able to have a successful and independent life. Julia was so ordinary, but since she took a few missteps in society's eyes, she was punished. Had she been richer or poorer, no one would have cared, yet middle class women in in the first half of the twentieth could not commit adultery without suffering consequences. Fiction becomes thinly disguised fact as Julia Almond's life mirrors the life of Edith Thompson who was tried for the the murder of her husband. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The ultra-high quality concept of A Night in a Moorish Harem is easier to explain than its actual narrative to summarize : due to somewhat contrived circumstances, a British Navy officer finds himself marooned on the Moroccan coast, where he finds shelter amid the nine concubines of a local ruler. These estimable ladies, as it turns out, are of different nationalities, to wit Spanish, \"Grecian\", Moorish, Italian, Circassian, Portuguese, Persian, Arabian and French (the latter being the most pretty and the least carnally satiable, for reasons that will not escape the savvy). Over the course of the night, he undertakes to pleasure all nine, to the complete satisfaction of his cosmopolitan saviours and the utter marvelment of readers, before escaping at dawn.\\nThis, however, is but the framing device of the book; between bouts of fornication, the randy women entertain their visitor with tales of their amourous past, and soon the captain in turn regales them with indiscrete evocations of his past experiences in the Home Islands and abroad, one of them positively Flashmanish. Much like Chaucers Canterbury Tales or Boccaccios Decameron, the book is mostly made of these stories within a story. The great advantage of such a premise it that it allows an important variety of tone from tale to tale. Indeed we are treated to comedy, tragedy, ribald farces and borderline Barbey dAurevilly dark pleasantries, cuckolds and star-crossed lovers.\\nUltimately however A Night in a Moorish Harem fails to fully exploit its premise by downplaying the differences between nationalities. To be fair the stories are clearly different in the islamist world and Europe, but within each group, nationalities are pretty much interchangeable. That is a lost opportunity and I would much have preferred the ladies adventures to be grounded of their societies mores. As it stands the book suggests that human copulatory behaviours are rather similar throughout the known world, which might be true enough, but then again, it is debatable whether realism has its place in that kind of books.\\nIt also lacks that spark of madness to make it a true classic rather than a simply competent work, and an overall average read.\\nAlso I found it on the Wikisource ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Living without water is something none of us on the planet can survive without. Droughts are often caused when there is no rain or moisture. And if there is no rain then plant life along with human life is lost. When there is no water then plant life can't grow. Food becomes scarce and survival becomes difficult. This is called famine.\\nDroughts and famine have happened throughout history. Famines can be a result of plant disease, bad weather such as floods or hail. In Western Ireland around 1845 the crops of potatoes turned black. The disease that spread was called Blight. In 1933, Guymon Oklahoma suffered the drought known as black blizzard. Between 1981 and 1984, drought killed crops across northern Ethiopia, in Africa.\\nTrying times with no water or food cause families to become desperate. They will do most anything to survive. Farmers in Forbes, Australia lost jobs and a lack of money affected the whole town. People in areas of Australia suffering from drought put out containers to collect all the rainwater they could. There is hope for the future. Rain and smarter farming practices can keep food growing and replenish the lands. \\nCunningham does an excellent job of taking a horrible subject and turn it into an educational and meaningful way for young readers to learn more about droughts and famine. Although this is a sensitive subject young readers, teachers and homeschoolers can learn about survival and how it's accomplished during these rough times. First hand stories, maps, photos and a glossary help readers better understand each situation. Readers can also find suggestions for books and websites to learn even more. \",\n",

       "  'comment': '<b>Summary:</b> A collection of poetry by an author primarily known for his fantasy novels. The poems are more contemporary, although they do draw from mythology and legend, as well as Kay\\'s travels, loves, and life. I think the one word to best summarize the tone of the book as a whole would be \"nostalgic\", although individual poems run the gamut from love-struck to bitter, from bleak to humorous.\\n<b>Review:</b> Well, if there\\'s one thing staring at my computer screen for the last half hour has proved to me, it\\'s that I don\\'t know how to review poetry. Heck, I barely know how to read poetry without a high school English class backing me up. Nevertheless, here goes nothing...\\nGuy Gavriel Kay is one of my favorite fantasy authors. He\\'s not just a writer, he\\'s a wordsmith, and his ability to stir deep emotion with one perfectly turned phrase is part of why I love his novels so much. So, I guess it shouldn\\'t be much of a surprise that his poetry shows the same careful craft and power of imagery and emotion.\\nI will admit that I was not crazy about the format. This is absolutely a subjective thing, but free verse poetry is just not my favorite, and free verse is all that\\'s to be found here. However, looking past that, the poems themselves were beautiful and lyrical, not the same as Kay\\'s prose but clearly springing from the same brain. Some I loved, some made me wistful and some made me smile, and some were totally opaque to me, even on repeated readings. I kept looking for interconnecting threads to bind each of the sections (there are five) together, and I think I can see them... but darkly. Overall, this was a departure for me, but an interesting one, and it might actually have convinced me to keep reading poetry, so that\\'s all to the good. 4 out of 5 stars.\\n<b>Recommendation:</b> Readers who come to this because they like Guy Gavriel Kay\\'s fantasy and are looking for more of the same are going to be disappointed. Readers who come because they love the lyricism of Kay\\'s writing, and his facility with turning the perfect phrase, or because they\\'re interested in contemporary poetry will enjoy it much more.

When he gets goes to live at his uncle's home, and he becomes good friends with a girl named Casey Kencaide, who is a horseback riding teacher at Ken's ranch.

He becomes more caring towards Casey and Ken and he also develops a closer relationship with them. I think that Travis has the potential to be a successful man because he has written his own book and it was published. \\nIn the book, Travis didn't make a lot of friends when he first moved to a new place. I can relate to this because it was first hard for me to make new friends at Moreau because there weren't a lot of people that went to Moreau from my old school.\\nThere wasn't anything that I didn't like in the this book. All the problems and characters were believable and that is why I liked the book.\\nI would recommend this book to teenagers because their are realistic relationship problems in this book between family member and friends.

Graham (The Five Owls, January/February 1987 (Vol. 1, No. 3))\\nThe power of Peter the Great and the incredible life of sixteenth-century Russia are the subject of Diane Stanley's new historical biography. The book begins when Peter is thirteen and reveals the remainder of his life along with the customs of that period. Peter comes alive as the boy who played war with real soldiers and whose every whim was gratified by a staff of dwarves and doting relatives. As a young man, our wily Peter discovers sailboats, and thus is the beginning of the Russian navy. He explores Europe and brings great change to his nation, which holds itself aloof from the rest of the world. Beards are shaved, cloaks are cut, and a certain European style enters Russia. Cities and architecture undergo dramatic transformation as Peter works hard to modernize Russia even at the expense of the peasant. St. Petersburg, once a marsh, becomes the capital of Russia. The text is at times tedious, but the illustrations are outstanding. The depth of color and the minute detail achieved by Stanley are splendid. Because of the importance history plays in the lives of children, it is with great appreciation that we greet the publication of Peter the Great. 1986, Four Winds, $12.95.

There are two storylines: one takes place in 1962 and portrays an Italian man who runs a hotel in an isolated little town, and falls in love with an American actress (an extra in Cleopatra) who mistakenly stays at his hotel. The other is in the recent past, and focuses on an administrative assistant to a movie/TV producer who is unhappy with her career. But that description doesn't even begin to really tell you what the book is about. \\nEach character's story explores the relationship between life and art, and the ways that art gives meaning to each person's life, or reflects their life's lack of meaning. This is an interesting thread to follow. I think the main thing that makes the book enjoyable is that the characters are all very vivid and likeable - even the guys who I would not like in real life were very sympathetic and enjoyable. \",\n",

Not only facing the pressures of school where she doesnt really fit in, but also knowing she is destined to be this one of a kind female dragon shifter known as the Wyvern. Puberty is supposed to trigger more than boobs for the female Pyr. It should also awaken the powers that seem content to stay MIA. \\nWhen an episode of bullying causes Zo to partially shift in front of a human, her father decides it is time for her to attend boot camp. Zo is excited to finally learn more about the ways of the dragon, and spend time with long time crush Nick. When an unexpected guest arrives and monopolizes all of Nicks attention, Zo finds her jealousy difficult to control. As boot camp progresses, tempers flare, and long time friends find themselves turning on one another. Will Zo be able to fix things and figure out what powers are at play?\\nFlying Blind takes place in 2024. It is apparently the spin off of Deborah Cookes adult PNR series, which stars the parents of the shapeshifting teens we meet in her Dragon Diaries series debut. I definitely feel this gave her writing a certain vibe that youd expect from an established author of a series aimed at adults. I really liked that, and felt it made it easier for me to connect to the key players even though Im quite a few years older than them. \\nI actually really enjoyed Zos voice. Especially her list making. As a list maker myself I found this little trait very endearing. Zo also seems to share my attraction to the bad boy type. Once you meet the motorcycle riding bad boy in Flying Blind you will see why. The romance itself was a very small part of the plot. The book definitely focuses more on the mystery, action, and Zos self-discovery. \\nI did find the whodunit portion of the book a little predictable, but this didnt detract from my enjoyment in the least. What grabbed my attention and kept me reading was my desire to watch Zo master her Wyvern powers. She was so used to being the underdog, and I really wanted to see her come out on top for a change. She is a very realistic heroine, aside from the shapeshifting power that is ;) She walks the line of insecurity without becoming whiny or pathetic. This gave her such a genuine feel. In a world where main characters sometimes are just a little bit too beautiful and life is just a little too easy, Zo is a nice change of pace. \\nFlying Blind is a great start to a new Young Adult series. After reading the first chapter of book #2, Winging It (available December 2011), Im eager to see what is in store for Zo next. ',\n",

Since the Cathars seem to have carried spiritual freedom to the point of dispensing with all dogmas, a position which is not free from objections, it was quite undoubtedly necessary that the Church should preserve the Christian dogma elsewhere in its integrity, like a diamond, with incorruptible strictness. But a little more faith would have prevented the conclusion that this necessitated their total extermination.\"Their horror of force was carried to the point of practising non-violence and to the doctrine which sees everything associated with the domain of force as originating in evil: namely, everything carnal and everything social. That was going far, but not further than the Gospel. For there are two sayings in the Gospel which go as far as it is possible to go. One of them is about those who become eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The other is spoken to Christ by the devil when showing him the kingdoms of the earth: \\'All this power will I give thee and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.\\'\" ',\n",

I'm pretty sure the book will make for an interesting discussion, but I thought this version was less focused (and less fun) than the last one. The added chapters -- on Internet shopping and international retailing -- were OK, but not especially interesting or relevant. The author was constantly me-me-meing and it got a little tedious. He also tried to cover way too much. What I most enjoyed about the book the first-time around was the detail about what his research discovered. That was lacking in the new chapters. Still, it's a fun read I recommend. (The librarian who leads our discussion group was afraid she wouldn't like the book at all. She read it early and LOVED it. She has some interesting stuff in store for us at our meeting.)\\n12/31/2009 \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'i think i just found a new favorite book. despite its intimidating size, this book was so incredibly rewarding. the storyline alone is wonderful, a lengthy tale of an australian convict on the run in india, finding himself living in the slums of bombay, running a free health clinic, living side by side in the farmlands during monsoon season, falling into council with the mafia goondas and joining the war efforts in afghanistan. woven into the fantastic story are some of the most wonderful characters i\\'ve ever read about, lovable, hysterical, disturbing and passionate. i found myself actually slowing down with this book, taking time to read and re-read passages that particularly moved me. i laughed and cried and travelled the world with this book and i absolutely adored it.i hear its to be made into a movie out in 2007, with johnny depp starring ::drool:: i can\\'t wait!some of my favorite quotes, and why this book hit so close to home:\"She was with a bad guy, a German guy, a junkie like her, who put her to work in a very tough place. A horrible place. She loved the guy. She did it for him. She would\\'ve done anything for him. Some women are like that. Some loves are like that. Most loves are like that, from what I can see. Your heart starts to feel like an overcrowded lifeboat. You throw your pride out to keep it afloat, and your self-respect and your independence. After a while you start throwing people out - your friends, everyone you used to know. And it\\'s still not enough. The lifeboat is still sinking, and you know it\\'s going to take you down with it. I\\'ve seen that happen to a lot of girls. I think that\\'s why I\\'m sick of love.\"\"our life began inside of the ocean millions of years ago near warm places under the sea. and for almost all of that long time, all the living things were water things, living inside of the sea. then a few hundred million years ago, maybe a little more - just a little while, really, in the big history of the Earth - the living things began to live on land, as well. but in a way, you can say, that after leaving the sea, after all those millions of years of living inside of the sea, we took the ocean with us. when a woman makes a baby, she gives it water, inside her body, to grow in. that water inside is almost exactly the same as the water of the sea. it is salty, by just the same amount. she makes a little ocean, in her body and gives it to the new life inside. and not only this, our blood and our sweat, they are both salty, almost exactly like the water from the sea is salty. we carry oceans inside of us, in our blood and our sweat. and we are crying the oceans, in our tears.\" ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Black Ships, a semi bland title for a bland book. Dont get me wrong, its not a bad book, its just bland. The tale follows a young cripple girl named Gull. She is given over to the priesthood and from there becomes the Priestess for a wandering group of refugees. They travel all over the Mediterranean, from Egypt and then back. Supposedly this is based on the Aenid, yet nothing in it seemed connected to it from what I remember. \\nThe Characters are one of my main problems with this book. Uninspired comes to mind when I think of them. Gull seems very stereotypical most of the time, and then the other part she is just contrary. She wants to do everything, which is normal, but her actions of doing it throughout the book are done in a non fluid way. Barley into the reading of the book I could already feel the story was going to involve some sappy fake love story, and come to find Gull with the ship captain I wasnt disappointed. Im all for love stories, but done in such an obligatory way really irks me. Motivations for most other characters were few and far between. They contain numerous loose ends, sparse character description, and typical / boring dialogue. \\nWhich brings us to the style of the book which I was not a fan of either. The writing style is not up to par with the scope of the story. Its a semi short book for all of the story contained, and its easy to see why. Broad swathes of time pass in the area of a paragraph or sentence. The whole scene doesnt seem to be described as well as it could. You dont get pulled into the world of this book like a Tolkien or King, but into the character and actions, which is the weakest link. \\nIts difficult trying to create an epic story. Written in shorter spans of times many of the weaknesses of this book could be overlooked. Yet overall this book isnt bad at all. I didnt feel like it was a chore to read it, yea wasnt drawn to it. This review makes it sound worse than it was, but that is sadly the nature of the thing. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Fear Principle is science fiction thriller with moderate to heavy expletives and violence.\\nAfter the \"Killing Times\", a time in human history where serial killing became an epidemic and barely a soul came out of the period unscathed, the government created a program of rehabilitation off-planet, by using the fears of the individual as a control technique. Some corporations, such as DIE, work in the shadows, creating super toys for the elite at the cost of everyone around them.\\nDr. Jaguar Addams has empathic abilities which she uses with her prisoners on Planetoid Three, to confront their basic fears, she takes their fears into herself and uses them to heal her subjects. With smoke, mirrors, actors and empathic mind push, she can make anyone stand up to their real selves and face that which most makes us shudder. Most times she is successful and for this reason she is given one of her toughest assignments yet. \\nClare Rilasco is an elite assassin, emotionless, hard and very driven. She has been captured and everyone wants a piece of her, some want the answers locked inside her brain and some don\\'t wish for her to share what she knows. She is given to Jaguar to unlock, but Clare isn\\'t without tricks of her own and soon the doctor becomes the student in a power struggle for the ultimate mind control.\\nAlex Dzarny is the director of the facilities on Planetoid Three, he is also an empath who uses his abilities to control the situations on the planet. He has a special spot for Jaguar and does all that he can to protect her.\\nNick Lyola is an ex-lover of Jaguars, who saved her life when she was a child during the \"Killing Times\". He is a renegade empath and the abilities he is learning could cause him to lose himself forever, as we watch his personality change for the worst as the story progesses. He is jealous of Alex and Jag\\'s \"friendship\" and will stop at nothing to control Jaguar and make her his again.\\nI liked the main plot, even though it was very slow paced and I quite enjoyed the empathic abilities of the characters. I enjoyed the mind games, the smoke and mirrors of the set up for the prisoners. I liked the character of Adrian and found him to be well written and was a nice surprise in the story, as well, I equally enjoyed Alex, Nick, Terrence and The Looker. I wasn\\'t overly fond of neither Jaguar nor Clare, I found both of them to be confusing and quite similar in nature, meaning, their wasn\\'t much distinction between their personalities, and you really had to pay attention to their dialogue or you\\'d miss who was saying what and had to back track your reading.\\nI didn\\'t like the back story very much, it just wasn\\'t believable, though I did like all the dead guy scenes, they were extremely well written and spooky to read. I wasn\\'t impressed with having to read over half of the book for it to begin to get interesting, if I had borrowed from the library, I\\'m not sure if I would renew it to see how it had finished, however, after you get thru a large portion of the book, then things begin to come together and a bit more interest ensues. I, myself, wasn\\'t overly fond of the read, the dialogue was disjointed in places and often got away from the writer, leaving a book that required more Planetoid Three and Killing Times back story to make it thoroughly interesting. Playing on your fears and connecting with them thru empathic abilities is a very neat idea but more examples could have been shared with the reader so that you can truly appreciate the Jaguar/Clare storyline.

       "  'comment': \"This book is like a 'What to Expect' for multiples, the 'bible' of twin, triplet, and quad pregnancies. Early on in my twin pregnancy, I was frustrated that most books, including 'What to Expect,' barely touched on multiple pregnancies and high risk topics, and much of the advice (exercise, working, bed rest, breastfeeding, labor, NICU, etc) wasn't applicable to me. When someone recommended Dr. Luke's book, I immediately checked it out from the library...and renewed it over and over again! Especially informative are the chapters on nutrition. Unlike a singleton pregnancy, eating healthy is not the primary goal, calorie consumption and weight gain are the focus. The book provides useful weight gain charts along with suggested timeframes, and the author explains in detail how momma's ideal weight gain is positively correlated to a longer gestational period and therefore bigger and healthier multiples. Dr. Luke provides ample encouragement and even suggests eating burgers and milk shakes if that's what it takes to meet the weight gain goals. If you are expecting multiples, don't bother with the 'other' pregnancy self-help books, this is the only book you'll need. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Article first published as Book Review: The Discovery of Socket Greeny by Tony Bertauski on Blogcritics.\\nAs technology takes hold in the world of today, imagine a world of tomorrow where virtual mode is used in every school system in the land. Leaving skin behind and entering into the internet, taking on a sim as a body, being who or whatever you want. But certain areas are approved through the schools and yet as with any rule, these are made to be broken, and other areas are hacked into, and small private wars are fought with other schools. Socket Greenys best friends are Chute, and Streeter. Streeter is the one with the computer savvy, and also the hacker extraordinaire. Chute is kind of like Sockets friend, but also like his girlfriend as well.\\nOn a day like any other, as they find themselves in their hacked universe, a small war ensues with the rival school. Sockets sim is damaged beyond repair, and as his team covers him, protecting his simulated body from further damage, he makes an amazing discovery. He can feel, and touch, which should be impossible in virtual mode. This is only simulation and not real and yet, it feels real. No pain but definitely real. He sees a shadow of someone familiar, and yet his friends have no idea, they cannot see or hear anything unusual. But they do know that Socket is acting odd, talking to no one that is there. As they are attacked once more, Socket pulls from deep inside and causes time to stand still; giving his team time to get together, but with the stand still, the earth begins to split, right up the middle, enclosing everything in its path. He blacks out and when he awakes he is back in his chair at school, the virtual mode is down and all hell has broken loose.\\nAnd he feels wrong somehow. Everything is different, as he and his friends Chute and Streeter are escorted to the office for creating problems, he finds that his mom has called and will be picking him up. Now he knows that trouble has found him, and yet, when she picks him up she does not comment on his day. She takes him to her place of work. Here she introduces him to some of the people that she works for, and he finds that he will be tested and probed for his experiences and his thoughts.\\nHis life as he knows it has just taken a huge curve, and he will be tested beyond endurance, and learn things about his parents that he never knew. He is in danger at every turn, and he continues to outpace his guides, in a game of life and death. Will he be able to help save the human race, or is it too late. Has it all been left too long? Will he ever be able to see Streeter and Chute again?\\nIn The Discovery of Socket Greeny, Tony Bertauski takes us deep into the virtual mode, to a world of imagination. Everything you want to do and whoever you want to be is possible. He sets up a group of heroes, shining knights if you will, a group of those with extraordinary powers who have chosen to save the human race. Time is of the essence and Socket has become a part of a larger picture, one he is not ready for. The time has come for him to fulfill his destiny, and to step into his fathers shoes.\\nBut who is he to trust when it is known that there is a traitor in their midst. He is pulled away from everything he knows and from his friends from home. His mom is acting like she does not know him most of the time, and he is never on his own. Everything he does is poked and prodded, and he is not ready to be what they want. An yet, he knows deep down that it is exactly what he wants, but will it be too late?\\nHis friends stand by him even when he disappears for a length of time, and forgive him for much. They love him and will do whatever it takes to bring him back to who he was. Little do they know that they too are being sucked into a war that is soon to happen.\\nThe characters are interesting, and at times quite brazen. I have problems understanding his mother, but she does have some redeeming qualities. When Socket needs her, he finds that he cannot always rely on her. The bad guys are deep from within the virtual mode itself and are ready to use it to take over the earth. There are some fun creative animals which show themselves to be quite useful, but are also very serious and yet frolicsome.\\nThis is a great novel for the Young Adult, or even those that are just young at heart. It is fast paced with incredible insight. The friendships are close and the interplay among Sprocket, Streeter and Chute is just plain fun. This is just what I remember about being young, but Sprocket has to grow up fast, and I believe that there is just the right amount of adventure to keep you reading. I recommend this book for your young reader, and believe that they will enjoy the adventure.\\nThis Book was received a a free E-Book from the author. All opinions are my own based off my reading and understanding of the material. ',\n",

A young man named Zach is waiting for his mother to show up at a diner with his medication, finds himself being held hostage by a pair of brothers who decide to rob the diner. The brother, obviously inexperienced robbers and hostage holders, stumble and bumble their way through the robbery.

       "  'comment': 'I really liked the first half of Terry Galloway\\'s Mean Little deaf Queer, but I found the 2nd half of the book fairly rambling and tedious to get through. I think Ms. Galloway has a ton of great stories to tell, and those that she does tell in full description are funny (not so much laugh out loud funny, perhaps more bemusing) and interesting and really catch the reader\\'s attention. When she goes on her tangents after starting a story and bounces around, it can be somewhat hard to figure out if she\\'s remembering the past or switching her main story or what the heck is going on. I almost felt like the bulk of this memoir was an outline for her to go back and expand upon. I would love to read more stories about her youth and her family as well as her theatre days and all her relationships (tortured and not). \\nI never felt this was a \"pity me\" memoir but more, this is how it was, this is my life, this happened, so deal with it. Her honesty with the lowest points in her life and very refreshing insomuch that she didn\\'t wallow in the low points as much as state that they happened. \\nOverall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about someone\\'s life that is definitely \"alternative\" (a term she uses a lot). It\\'s not for the faint of heart or the prissy, so if those who get their sensibilities all bent out sort because of the smallest thing probably should pass this book by.\\nI hope Ms. Galloway writes more and centers her writing on specifics of her life instead of trying to encompass so much in so little space.

       "  'comment': 'I had high hopes for this one. It had all the makings of a great book. It had all the makings of a dystopia and I liked the background setting. Deuce seems to be living in a rather tribal like society where you are classified into different groups depending on how useful you are. It was really interesting, and I liked reading this part of the book. Deuce herself is an interesting character, shes tough and Fade is just as tough as her, so they make an good working pair. It was only inevitable where youll run into romance between the two, although I didnt see the romance being so great. Yes, Deuce and Fade made a great pair when it came to survival and working together, but romantically, I dont know, I just didnt see it. It was flat and they just did not have that spark youd expect in most YA couples.\\nThe best part was the incident with the gang. That to me, was very real, and expected in a post apocalyptic setting. I was actually glad this wasnt sugar coated to make it easy on the eyes for younger readers. They were most certainly brutal, and their behavior towards Deuce is horrible - but expected. (That being said, this book should be geared towards older teens). I did not expect Stalker to change so quickly, and I didnt expect Fade and Deuce to be so forgiving and trusting. Youd think of all theyve been taught and been through, theyd tie up Stalker and watch him being fed to the wild animals?\\nSo a few things bothered me about this book. The fact that Deuce and Fade - despite their training and survival skills, end up being so nice to Stalker, and the fact that everywhere they went in this post apocalyptic world, they found food. EVERYWHERE. It was all conveniently placed. Call me cynical, or very pessimistic, but most books Ive read that had this kind of setting, food was scarce, and few and far between. This did not sit well with me and my interest in the book started to wane. The fighting parts however, were good and well done, they were exciting and action packed. I especially liked how Tegan even was able to defend herself!\\nI wanted to like this book. I really did. I did like some aspects of it but other parts of it did not sit too well with me to fully appreciate the post apocalyptic story. Perhaps Im being too picky but it just felt like some things were just a little too conveniently placed for them to take the easy way. I will be reading the next book, as the unanswered questions and the open ending got me curious. Is this the book that beats Hunger Games? definitely not. Dystopia readers could give this a try just for a look at a different type of society. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'What a roller coaster ride of emotions A Passion Most Pure takes the reader on! Not only are the romantic readers satisfied by the countless warm moments, but this book over bounds with lessons! Faith\\'s personal relationship with the Lord was really sweet and watching her parents, Patrick and Marcy, relying on the Lord through every dark moment was inspiring. You can\\'t read A Passion Most Pure and not learn something by the end!\\nThis was Julie Lessman\\'s debut novel, and I\\'m blown away by it. It was so well written and each character brought to such vivid life! Her writing was bold, but at the same time so soft and sweet! I can really understand now why Julie continues to rack up fans as she keeps turning out such powerful fiction!\\nI\\'d personally recommend this book to mature or adult readers. There are many sensual and passionate kisses between different characters throughout the book that, depending on the reader, might be okay or way too much. Collin and Mitch are both known to sleep around frequently with other women (but as the story progresses, I was excited to see them changing!). There\\'s cheating on relationships (with painful consequences following) and once Charity thinks about her best features while undressing. Patrick and Marcy have a lot of tender moments and frequently \"make love\" to each other, though Julie doesn\\'t go into explicit detail beyond heated kisses.\\nThe tender moments between Patrick and Marcy were actually one of my favorite parts of the book. I love reading about couples that have been married for years, but still are madly in love with each other! So sweet! When I reached the end of this book, I was elated at how Faith\\'s story ends...but at the same time, I was dying to know what would happen to Mitch and if Charity would ever learn her lesson! Also, I was a little disappointed that Faith didn\\'t ask Charity\\'s forgiveness for the things she said and did before leaving. I was kind of hoping she\\'d make peace with her before it ended. Guess I\\'ll just have to wait and see in A Passion Redeemed!\\nSo, all in all, I enjoyed this read. Definitely a pretty edgy romance for me, with many passionate kisses, but the passion wasn\\'t all about kissing, either--there was also the passion in Patrick and Marcy\\'s marriage, the passion for the Lord in Faith, and a passion to find true healing, love, and acceptance in Collin. There were parts in A Passion Most Pure that had me smiling in joy, and other times that had me in a puddle of tears. No character in here is perfect, each one stumbles--as we all do in this life.

       "  'comment': \"Let me preface this review by saying that I rarely (and I mean very rarely) ever read the horror genre. I went through a phase, during my early teen years, where that's all I read. But I decided, quickly, that I preferred reading stories of more depth and complexity, stories that didn't patronize me, the reader, or insult my intelligence. Hence, I moved on to epic fantasy and other fantasy sub-genres and never looked back. \\nSo I had many misgivings when this novel by David Burton won the poll for Book of the Month for June/July 2010 for the GoodReads Fantasy Book Club. \\nI survived reading The Second Coming with many winces at the cliches, the need for a good copy editor and the hope that the adage 'Show, don't tell' might have triumphed. The irrelevant sexual content and innuendo, so pervasive in this genre, distracted more than enticed. I never once felt the shock of horror or the thrill of suspense. Most of the time, when I wasn't nodding off, I just wanted to reach the end, or at least for the words to stop so I could move on to something more challenging and fulfilling. \\nFantasy elements in this story are limited to necromancy, blood rites and other similar tropes of the horror genre. Supernatural entities, like demons, fallen angels and possessed mortals pervade. Towards the 'climactic' ending, the characters swapped souls like some people trade recipes or gossip. Sadly, by that point, I didn't care who ended up in what body. Or bodiless, like the poor loser in the musical chairs soul roulette. \\nI tried to overcome my prejudices with the horror genre, but I failed miserably with The Second Comaing. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Mitsuko, the young medium, Hasunuma his openly gay classmate and friend, and Ichi their mutual friend, are staying at the Shinto temple with chief priest Mikuni. Mikuni is scheming for ways to trick visitors out of money when another medium shows up on their doorstep. Itsuki, the medium, is followed by a mysterious, silent male shrine maiden named Shino, who is apparently in love with him. The characters are somewhat difficult to tell apart in this one. Especially Hasunuma and Itsuki. I'm not sure why Mikuni is transformed into a baby in the end (!?). \\nI found the second story, Lucky Boys at Dawn, hard to follow. It involves Mikuni's family, a goat spirit/demon and a haunted mask. The final story, Sweet Festival deals with the Japanese Valentine's Day tradition of girls giving chocolate to boys they like. Mitsuo really started to annoy me in this one, with all of his worry about saving face and appearing masculine and popular by having a girl give him chocolates. Then, Hasunuma risks humiliating himself by dressing up in drag and pretending to be Mitsuo's secret admirer, and Mitsuo still gives him the brush off. Hasunuma has an awful lot of patience to put up with Mitsuo's hot and cold reactions to him. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Very few authors can skewer social mores and traditions like Jane Austen. In Northanger Abbey, she tackles the ever-popular topic of love and always amusing profession of marriage-seeking. Catherine is one of her meeker heroines -she doesn't have the forwardness of Emma or the seriousness of Elizabeth Bennet - yet her exploits find their way into the reader's heart. This only serves to strengthen Austen's ever-present commentary on the life as a woman in the 19th century.\\nNorthanger Abbey is unique among the Austen canon because it was written in two parts at two very different points in her life. Because of this, there is a distinct difference in the overtness of her satire that creates a very different feel among each of the sections. The first section is decidedly more subtle in its mocking. A reader may not catch everything, especially readers unfamiliar with the very Gothic novels which provided Austen with her fodder. However, this section is brilliant in its slyness. Conversely, the second section is much more obvious with its satiric intent. In fact, a reader is all but knocked over the head with it. Each section has its merits, but it does give the novel a rather jagged, somewhat disconnected feel.\\nAs my book club was quick to share, the ending of Northanger Abbey is seriously rushed. True romantics may not enjoy the fact that the resolution occurs within five pages, with the end following on the sixth page. However, Austen's satiric commentary is less on marriage and more on the courtship the precedes it. Once Austen states her arguments about the inane politics and machinations of husband- (or wife-) hunting, there is little else that needs to be stated. In this light, the ending makes sense, even if it is slightly unsatisfying to readers who hope for a little more happily-ever-after. To continue the story would be to dilute her entire message, and Austen has always been all about her messages.\\nNorthanger Abbey has always been one of my favorite of the Austen novels, even more than the traditionally popular among her works. There is something about Catherine's cluelessness that is as amusing as it is head-shaking, and the rest of the cast of characters are all too familiar in our modern world. Austen's message about confusing art with life is still appropriate today, as it is exceedingly easy to name at least one popular modern series which has created a rabid fan base that tends to blur the lines between fact and fiction. Reading Northanger Abbey drives home the point that the more things change, the more things stay the same. For an enjoyable story which highlights the differences in Austen's writing style over the years and in which the lessons to be learned by Catherine's plight remain as true today as they did when first penned, Northanger Abbey is well worth the read.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Seldon wrote one of the standard works on the development of Yenan as a stronghold of Communism. He looks at how the CCP developed a policy that would have broad appeal to the peasantry and how that became official PRC policy, even into the Cultural Revolution.\\nSeldon first looks at the situation in Yenan, which was isolated from most of the civil war. The peasantry were not highly politicized prior to the CCP arriving there, but severe drought conditions, famine and corruption had led to general unrest. Once the CCP military strength could establish safe zones, they were able to introduce land redistribution and gain more peasant support.\\nEarly CCP guerillas were little more than robin hood style bandits, but eventually developed a land-redistribution policy that gained large support. When Mao and the CCP leadership arrived after the Long March, the remoteness of Yenan made it an ideal HQ. It was also remote from Japanese incursions even after 1937. The United Front forced the CCP to suspend some of its more radical programs until after WWII. After the war, the CCP resumed those programs and worked on a policy of mass revolution instead of revolution from above. This, more than anything, is was Selden means by the Yenan way.\\nAlmost 40 years after its initial publication, this remains a standard work of the development of CCP policy and strategy. It is a must read for any student of the CCP or PRC. ',\n",

He escapes from the hospital on a mysterious quest to save the world under the guidance of the angel Dulcinea and with his sidekick Gonzo. They survive a whirlwind of quixotic adventures, but the line between real and hallucination, between waking and dreaming, is unclear. Are any of these experiences real, or are they mad cow-induced hallucinations?

The biggest weakness of Going Bovine is that the characters are not really developed until the final few chapters of this very long novel. It is almost entirely action-driven, but the action sequences are difficult to care about if one believes that they are simply hallucinations, especially given Cameron's negativity and two-dimensionality throughout a good two hundred pages or more. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This volume ends with the writer\\'s summary of which points each type of reader should have picked up from the main characters\\' trials and tribulations.\\nThere is a second volume that I gather continues describing the new life Pamela finds in the course of this novel, but the introduction for this edition written in 1914 by George Saintsbury says: \"He [Richardson] had better not have done it\", so I think I\\'ll leave well enough alone.\\nAnd to be honest, the first half of this first volume was much better than the second half.\\nThe story starts out with a gripping plot, a fast pace, excellent writing. I flew through the pages, wanting more, more, more. These are the pages where all the drama is.\\nSome of the themes have a modern feel to their presentation.\\n<b>Begin Spoiler:</b>\\nSexual harassment dynamics haven\\'t changed over the centuries, that\\'s clear. Pamela faces the same \\'choices\\' any modern woman faces when the head of the company decides he likes her pretty face and won\\'t take no for an answer.\\nThe difference between modern woman and Pamela is that modern woman can press charges at the local police office whereas Pamela can\\'t.\\nHelp from her colleagues then? Nope. Some don\\'t believe her, some look the other way, some say he didn\\'t mean to do so, and some are on his side.\\nPamela next finds herself Mr. B\\'s captive in his second house. She is guarded by an evil Mrs. Jewkes. Mr. B. waits patiently at his Bedfordshire estate till Pamela gives in to his wishes. \\nAt this point I believed Mr. B. to be something of a psychopath.\\nAnd was sure his patience wouldn\\'t last long, which indeed it doesn\\'t. He decides to pay a visit to hasten Pamela\\'s downfall.\\nBut lo and behold, the beast seems to have emotions, and turns kind and decent all of a sudden.\\nAnd even though Pamela refuses the very generous \\'mistress contract\\', he continues to be so.\\nPamela even starts to like him, which did not surprise me since she was after all set up perfectly to start suffering Stockholm Syndrome, and she is overjoyed when the squire finally proposes marriage for real.\\nThe explanation given for the squire\\'s bad behavior is that he was set no limits as a child, he was spoiled and never learned to brook refusal. Power corrupts then, unless your name is Pamela and you have had Mr. and Mrs. Andrews as your parents, teaching you the power of goodness and virtue.\\n<b>End spoiler</b>\\nThe second half of the book is a beautiful study of goodness, virtue, remorse, redemption and how they may affect your day to day life. Also very nice, but not what a modern reader would expect as a nice climax to an exciting tale. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"The interesting thing about this book was Kimball's point of view, which is never more than 5 feet distant from the muck. This is not some soft-focus, romantic tale (though if that's what you are looking for, see my recent review of [b:The Pioneer Woman: Black Heels to Tractor Wheels -- A Love Story|8483233|The Pioneer Woman Black Heels to Tractor Wheels -- A Love Story|Ree Drummond|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1301845902s/8483233.jpg|13348402]) but rather a book wherein you find yourself up close with the author, smelling the contents of a gored bull's wound for intestinal spillage, and when she finds it, knowing there's about to be a gunshot. Farming for the realist, let's say. \\nThere was a lot of hard work in this book and very little about the business model of the farm, which is to provide the total nutritional requirements for each of its subscribers every year. It's a model I find really intriguing, and one I'd like to read more about. I think Kimball's husband teeters on the edge of madness/genius/madness, and he was interesting to read about. \\nI get that Kimball is way too busy to write about everything, and the memoir she wrote is interesting- it's just not enough. It could have been much more compelling if there had been more, um, meat.\\nA very enjoyable book, but certainly not one for the squeamish. \",\n",

Actually, I don't think I needed to explain that. The book is that simple, and that unexciting. It has some value for beginning education. Kids need to learn to label everything, and they like animals. The pictures are nice but not spectacular, and similarly, children will think this book is mildly entertaining, but not fabulous. On a side note, we have another board book exactly like this one, just with different pictures and words, but we like it more because we created a fun game surrounding the pictures. I guess we should have been more creative with this one, and we could rate it higher. Still, a book should stand on its own terms in quality, and this one is just mediocre. \",\n",

Their journey is incredibly emotional, powerful, beautiful and stands out in my mind as the Mack Daddy in the genre of healing/comfort books, which is a current personal favorite of mine.

All completely new to me, I wasn\\'t even aware that Cyprus was, or ever had been, part of the British Empire. But of course, with the Suez Crisis looming, England needs to keep a foothold in the Mediterranean, so Cyprus is incredibly important.\\nAnd the Greek Cypriots are waging a nerve-wracking guerilla war against the British soldiers, and also against their families, leading to tragedy.\\nThe family at the centre of this book is Major Hal Treherne, his wife Clara, and their young twin daughters, who are newly moved to Cyprus. The tension starts to build early as they are unable to be housed in the army grounds with the other families, and as is normal with guerilla wars, one never knows where the enemy is. Even when they do manage to move into an army house near the other English families, terrorism manages to rear its ugly head and Clara is badly affected by the uncertainty and the terror. Matters are not helped by Hal\\'s own concerns with his role and duties, leaving him unable to fully concentrate on Clara when she most needs it. Sometimes the \"small\" wars are just as devastating as the \"big\" wars.\\nThis was a great, unputdownable, complex read. Fabulous stuff. Well written, believable characters, fascinating piece of history I knew nothing about, and genuinely moving. ',\n",

This one rather focuses more on Modo and Colette (another spy but for the French) aboard a submarine. The addition of Griff into the story- who makes a perfect creepy villain, also made the book a great read.\\nWhat I enjoyed the most out of the story is the underwater city. I absolutely loved that part! the descriptions, the overall feel to it was so rich in description and was easily pictured. It was like reading a description of the lost city of Atlantis. The book has a certain Captain Nemo feel to it because of the adventure at sea but the intrigue is what sets it apart and thats where Griff comes in and provides a spectacular role. He does make a chilling villain despite this book meant for children, I have read nasty villains before, but this one fits perfect for the target age audience. \\nI thought Colette and Modo made a great team! they worked great together - its an interesting contrast to what you see with Octavia and Modo (where they bicker at times - which is cute) but Colette seems to be the more calm, mature type character whereas I see Octavia as a small explosive firecracker (for lack of a better terminology!). Im actually liking the fact that Octavia does really care about Modo, as she does show how she really feel throughout the book. \\nId have to say, I think the only thing I did not really like is the late entrance of the Clockwork Guild. I thought they were going to be in the book for longer but no, so it was just a little disappointing. I was hoping there would be more of them hanging around (Well, Griff doesnt really count. Sort of. I was hoping for more of Miss Hakkandottir.) \\nThis was a great follow up to the First Hunchback Assignments. I did recently grab the third one; Empire of Ruins and am hoping it will be just as good! This series has to be one of my favorites of Childrens Fiction. ',\n",

But since it was my fault I didn\\'t get finished (I completely forgot that my ebook would expire after 2 months!!) and since this was a strong collection of short stories, I\\'ll talk about the ones I did read.\\nStrong start: The Hoarder\\nThe story\\'s main character is obsessed with collecting things, but his penchant for acquisition takes a dark turn when he sets his sights on his brother\\'s girlfriend. Quiet and deliberate, this story moves with a dull weight.\\nMy favorite: The Uninnocent\\nThis one stuck with me. Two children, in desperate need of a good psychologist, \"deal\" with the death of their brother by looking for messages sent by him from beyond, and carry out what they interpret as his instructions with disturbing results. Poor Butter.\\nFell flat: Amazing Grace\\nAmazing Grace didn\\'t work for me. It just seemed a bit too easy in terms of the choices Morrow made. Man loses sight. Man becomes a motivational speaker. Man miraculously regains sight only to learn he may have been better off left in the dark about what his family had been up to behind his back (pun absolutely intended). Overly reliant on religious crutches, at times cliche...I felt like I always knew exactly what was going to happen next. This story is actually why I didn\\'t finish the book. Morrow is so touted as a master of American noir, and when I read this genre, I prefer mine to be a balance of the quiet/familiar with the disturbing/unexpected. \\nRubric rating: 6. I definitely want to finish this collection. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"While When Christ and His Saints Slept is easily the best book of the trilogy, Penman does not disappoint with Devil's Brood. Devil's Brood follows the sons of Henry Fitz Empress and Eleanor of Acquitane through all of their rebellions, double dealings, false apologies, and betrayals. Each of the sons has their own personalities and quirks and theirs story alone could have easily filled up a trilogy of its own. I also find it hard to have any sympathy for most of the characters, except Henry, he truly did not understand why his sons would rebel against him and it was just so sad to read page after page of his utter bafflement. Eleanor was also a constant source of anger for me, I found her to be haughty, selfish, and ultimately just horribly horribly annoying. To be completely honest though my main grievance with the book is the sheer length, at almost 800 pages it is rather lengthy and at times I found myself wanting to skip parts just to get through it. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'About 1/5 of the way through Hatchet, the main character sums up his experience very succinctly: My name is Brian Robeson and I am thirteen years old and I am alone in the north woods of Canada (46). That, in a nutshell, is the plot of Gary Paulsens Newbery Honor Book, Hatchet. Of course, while the storyline is relatively simple (young boy survives a plane crash and must survive in the wilderness with only the eponymous hatchet to help him), what Paulsen does with the story is truly unique. Rather than fall prey to Hollywood-style serendipity and surrealism, Paulsen captures the painful reality of life in the wilderness - complete with animal encounters, failed fire-making, and Darwinian survival of the fittest.\\nHatchet seems to be custom-made for the middle school male: the main character is thirteen years old (roughly 7th/8th-grade status), and he battles the wilderness without the presence of any adult supervision or presence. Additionally, Paulsen understands the short attention span of his target audience and adjusts accordingly: the first chapter of Hatchet ends with the pilot of Brians plane dying of a heart attack, and the story only gets more intriguing from there. In fact, so much of Hatchet (like Old Man and the Sea) relies upon character development and the ability of a human being to tame the untamable wild. Watching Brian grow from a weak suburban boy to a masterful child of the wilderness is a truly rewarding experience; likewise, the reader is fascinated and awe-struck by Brians education in the wild and his survival instincts. I can only imagine how exciting this book might be for the suburban middle-school crowd, kids who view the wilderness as a foreign entity like outer space.\\nThe most unfortunate part about reading Hatchet today (twenty-three years after its publication) is that it seems clichd: since the books publication, weve had the film Castaway, the reality show Survivor, and even the indefinably weird TV drama Lost. Sadly, what seemed novel and unique in 1987 now just seems like another part of the cultural landscape.\\nWhile Hatchet might not be my kind of book, it definitely is a powerful work of fiction. Reluctant readers, especially young men, will undoubtedly have an appreciation for the man vs. nature experience of Brian Robeson. Perhaps every child should pack a copy of the book on camping expeditions into the wild... just in case. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Coraline is a children's horror story about a girl called Coraline (not Caroline) who is a bit bored. After exploring her new apartment, she finds a door that sometimes leads to a brick wall, and other times leads to a slightly twisted version of her own apartment, and beyond. Coraline explores this interesting new world, although many things made me want to run straight back into her boring old life. Especially when the mysterious connection between her new home and old home might not guarantee her exit when she pleases. I get very paranoid about that sort of thing, so it really put me on edge.\\nI loved reading Coraline. Didn't scare me, but I didn't expect it to. Instead, I would say it 'creeped me out a bit'. I think if I read this as a child, I'd be able to take out the 'a bit', and I'd probably love it even more! The monsters, taking an incredibly twisted form of the people Coraline knew from her old world, were so much fun to read about. Fun in a twisted, scary kind of way :)\\nI've given a copy to my cousin for her birthday and I think she really liked it. Now I want my own copy, since I'd borrowed it from the library. We both can't wait for the film now. Here in Australia we have to wait till August to see it :(\\nI would recommend reading this before seeing the film - not because the film isn't as good (I couldn't say myself anyway, having not seen it), but because the images created by Gaiman's writing seemed to thrive in my imagination. The words really took on a dream-like (perhaps nightmarish) quality in my mind that so fit the story, and I had so much fun with it! It made me feel like a child again, with my over-active imagination.\\nIf you've enjoyed the film but havent read the book, I still would recommend it, although I can't say for sure without seeing the movie. But it's a short book anyway, and it's hardly going to waste your time.\\nRecommended for all ages, although not for young ones easily scared.\\nI know I like to know the age and gender of reviewers when I try to find out whether I'll like a book. So I'm female, 16 years old, and that is what I think of Coraline. Thank you for reading!\\n[On my ratings scale, a 4.5 means 'I loved it'. I've only given 3/65 books 5 stars (as of April 2009), so the 4.5 just means it didn't blow me completely away. I rate not by how good the book is, but how much I enjoy it.] \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"At least as far as the science goes, it seems solid enough--so a much better book than some of Gladwell's and Iyengar's The Art of Choosing. Partnoy really is a Renaissance man in that he's a lawyer who was a trader for Morgan Stanley, now a professor of some sort and graceful writer. You'd never guess he was a lawyer or former corporate drone from the writing.\\nThe problems arise when he goes on and on with examples based on the thinnest findings. Notably apologies in the wake of sex scandals involving US politicians. No doubt when you flub big-time, you might want to wait a day or two to make your apology sound really sincere. But it's absurd to compare these various men's escapades for a start because their transgressions were so different (Spitzer was tracked to a prostitute because law enforcement thought bank withdrawals suggested he was being blackmailed; a southern governor, having an overseas affair wasn't breaking any law, just worrying a lot of people; some may have/were been breaking laws. Some told public lies before discovery; some didn't. Etc.)\\n*most of whose names Americans will have forgotten already and foreigners won't know; otherwise, people beyond the US won't be bothered by the other chapters.\\nThat's just the start of my objections to that chapter (What is timing, after all?). But there are better chapters. I liked how views of procrastination have changed through the ages.Often we're going through a cost-benefit process and there's something to be gained by putting off a task. And even when you're not going project A that doesn't mean you're doing *nothing*.\\nAnd inevitably we always return to Kahnmann and Tversky and the way people weigh ricks and rewards--that people aren't the rational men (and women) or classic economic models. I'd rather take the $1 extra today then wait a month or two for $5. That of course does not mean that I wouldn't wait a month for $5,000 in lieu of $1,000 today. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Notes on one story - Greasy Lake\\nIt\\'s about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight\\nBruce Springsteens words are the first we read at the beginning of Greasy Lake, a short story written by T.C. Boyle in 1981.\\nGreasy Lake provides the destination for Crazy Janey and Wild Billy in song and the destination for Jeff and Digby in story. Both song and story have unnamed narrators who recount a night at Greasy Lake, each with different outcomes.\\nT.C. Boyles story focuses on a small group of friends, college age, seeking experiences on an early June evening to match the image they have built for themselves: dangerous characters. Their search is initially unsuccessful (The first two nights wed been out till dawn, looking for something we never found.), but the third night eventually brought exactly what they were looking for  a dangerous situation for dangerous characters.\\nOh, you don\\'t know what they can do to you\\nSpirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)\\nStand right up now and let it shoot through you (Bruce Springsteen)\\nThe spirits in the night of Boyles story infuse the three friends with a violent response after stumbling into an unexpected confrontation with a couple in a car, a car they thought would contain another friend, Tony, with some little fox. The initial violence is recounted with images of Rockettes and Bruce Lee, images that make you smile about a prank gone bad, but suddenly a tire iron swung by the narrator fells the bad greasy character who took exception to their prank. Time stops as they assume he is dead, killed instantly by the blow to his head. The effect was instantaneous, astonishingHe collapsed. Wet his pants. Went loose in his boots. \\nThey are brought back to the moment by a raw torn shriek, a scream from the fox as she ran at them in rage. The blood lust of the situation heightens. All three are described as being in the grip of the purest primal badness while grabbing her, tearing at her clothes with the intent of raping her. The arrival of another car halts the attack and the friends scatter, the narrator running toward Greasy Lake to make another horrific discovery in this horrible night. While attempting to swim the lake, to escape from whoever arrived at the scene, the narrator stumbles upon a body floating in the lake, later surmised to be the owner of a nearby motorcycle, a bad older character come to this.\\nWe later discover that the tire iron did not deliver a fatal blow. We are privy to the description of the distant sounds of the narrators car (his mothers car) being destroyed with that same tire iron: windshield, headlights, taillights, and body. The greasy character and his friends take their leave, having extracted some semblance of revenge for the events of the night.\\nAs dawn approaches, our original group of friends gather around the battered car, still in running condition, but a visual testament to the chaos of the night, a night in which they were caught up in the badness they sought at Greasy Lake.\\nJust as they are to leave, two drunken and stoned young women arrive in a car, calling out the name of the biker, whose body is floating in the lake, the body discovered by the narrator during his night of terror. The disappearance of Al, their biker friend, lifeless in Greasy Lake, is quickly forgotten. Rather, they see an opportunity; an opportunity to share some tablets in glassine wrappers, an opportunity to party.\\nWild Billy said, \"Trust some of this it\\'ll show you where you\\'re at, or at least it\\'ll help you really feel it\" (Bruce Springsteen)\\nThroughout the story, knowing that they had found what they were looking for, the narrators only stated epiphany is the realization that the obscenesoft, wet, moss-grown object he stumbled upon in the lake was a corpse, the waterlogged corpse of the biker. We never witness what insight he may have gained, even in retrospect (since the story is told from his perspective many years later). We are left to wonder if he found anything other than horror that night, anything other than the fear of being caught or the fear of creating a believable story as to what happened to the car. This point is brought home in his response to the young girls who inquire about Al. Al. I didnt know what to say. I wanted to get out of the car and retch, I wanted to go home to my parents house and crawl into bedWe havent seen anybody, I said. He doesnt immediately face up to the consequences of the night. We hear no regret as he tells the story years later. We dont know if he really felt it at all. \\nSo we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right (Bruce Springsteen)\\nThe characters in Bruces song felt so right at the end of their night at Greasy Lake. Boyles characters are numb, zombies, like war veterans, like deaf-and-dumb pencil peddlers. Like one of the girls at the end of the story, we are left in a daze, standing thereshoulders slumped, hand outstretched hoping they learned something. I can hope, but I dont believe they did.',\n",

       "  'comment': \"While this study of Jacob Brown has its virtues, the fact that it's so focused on the life of its subject makes it mostly attractive to a serious student of the War of 1812 or the Early Republic. That said, Morris doesn't slight the military or personal details of Brown's life, and offers extra value by spending a good portion of his book examining Brown's role in the reorganization of the Army after the war; finding Brown to have been overshadowed unjustly by John C. Calhoun's activities as Secretary of War.\\nIf I have to mark down this book, it's because that more could have been done to put Jacob Brown into context. Brown reminds one of the men of affairs who made themselves into competant field officers during the Revolutionary War (Washington, Nathaniel Greene, Anthony Wayne, etc.) and is thus something of the last of his type. This is seeing as American field command through the Civil War would either devolve on men in the model of frontier leaders such as Andrew Jackson or on the rising professional class of officers issuing from West Point; at least it was this sort of officer who would receive the public acclaim. \",\n",

As a result, this is a valuable book. The author writes about things many people without mentally ill relatives wouldn't think of -- how J's illness has taken over every aspect of their lives, how it's hard to plan anything because they never know when he might need help, how heartbreaking it is to see an intelligent and promising young man deteriorate like this, how difficult it is to get other people to see beyond his illness to the good, kind person he is. Having a relative with schizophrenia, Hanson points out, is much more difficult than having a relative with a chronic illness like cancer, because of the stigma attached and because the mentally ill person often doesn't believe they're ill and will resist treatment.\\nI think families of the mentally ill would find much moral support from this book. Those mentally ill people who have insight into their condition might also benefit from reading it and seeing their illness through their families' eyes. I only with Hanson had included a list of support organizations in the back. \",\n",

Money can even sabotage those intentions, twisting belief of reason to a belief in money. Even the best of intentions change for the ever-elusive dollar.\\nIn 3-Lies by Helen Hanson, we follow the lives of Beth Sutton and her new boyfriend Clint Masters, as well as his faithful dog Louie. Beth is a kind and loving young woman, finding love at a time when her life is not at its best. On dialysis, she has not kept her diagnosis a secret from Clint, allowing him to know everything about her from the start. Beginning a relationship with secrets is in no way acceptable to her or her way of life. If he can deal this this than she understands, he can deal with anything.\\nKidnapped in a bizarre scheme by a group of terrorists in an effort to blackmail the Supreme Court Justices, Beth is at the mercy of a group with nothing to lose. Bewildered by the action taken by her family, Clint is confused. They not only refuse to report her missing, they file a restraining order against him as a stalker. He struggles with the enormity of the circumstances as he feels her life leak away the longer she is away from both her medication and her dialysis machine. Without them, her system will shut down, and yet he is anathema to the family. \\nTo top it all off his best friend is after him to come back into the business and his soon to be ex-wife has just announced to him that he is going to be a father. Yet none of this makes sense, or compares to the terror he feels at Beths disappearance. Not entirely sure of his feelings for her prior to the event, he is now more than ever convinced that he loves her and there is the possibility that he will never see her again.\\nIn a separate situation within the CIA, a young agent Doug Bryant has stumbled on an old code file, one that seems to bring some disturbing information about agents gone missing. Due to his discovery, his clearance is elevated and he is now in the ranks of those with need to know priorities. As he delves into the files themselves, he finds missing funds, missing ships, and a spy in their midst. What is going on with this missing group of agents, and how will he be able to help with his lack of experience?\\nAs both investigations begin to intermesh, the CIA in in the dark about the missing person occurrences, those that deal with the disappearances of the friends and family members of several of the Supreme Court Justices. As every move Doug makes is blocked, he finally finds some of the information he needs to go forward. But who does he trust? He thinks he knows but how can he be sure?\\nWhen the leads bring him and his lead together with Clint, they begin to see the scheme as it unfolds. Murder and kidnapping, are just a few of the capabilities of this group of individuals they are tracking. Can they get the information and find Beth in time? When the clues all come together, will they be able to stop this plot from going forward. In a race against time, with lives at stake will Doug and Clint decipher the clues in time?\\nHanson has developed a diabolical plot, ones that seems both real and deadly. Her characters, from Beth to Clint, from Doug to the other captives, deliver on the reality of people with whom you can relate. They are human with both strengths and flaws. Overcoming obstacles, and yet at times showing such human emotions, sadness, sympathy, jealousy, and spite, it is easy to imagine the interaction. I was impressed how Hanson was able to take two separate occurrences and draw a line between the two, intersecting and bringing them to fruition in a way that is both believable and impressive.\\nI would recommend this book for the suspense and thriller seeker. It also delivers on romance, action and adventure, and just a bit of stepping outside of who you are. Once started, I could not put it down. The writing is genuine and the feelings are heartfelt. This would be a wonderful book for your library. I look forward to reading more from Helen Hanson, she has an artistry that is hard to deny.\\nThis book was received as a free download from the author.

       "  'comment': \"This book is a great example of Fantasy because the penguins in the book cheered and talked and sang, and we know that penguins cannot do this in real life. The Illustrations in this book were great. The media used was a combination of watercolor and ink and wash. The Author used 3rd person, describing the events that happened to these penguins in the past tense. A group of penguin students want to compete in a cheer contest, but they are afraid Tacky will hold them back. In the clearly sequenced plot (Beginning, Middle and End) Tacky and his class is introduced, Tacky is identified as different. The team practices their cheer, and the team presents their cheer and wins with Tacky's silly contributions. A great book about embracing differences.\",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Books change us. They have the power to influence us. Our mind may be changed, our opinion may be swayed or our resolve may be strengthened. But when we put the book down, we walk away a little different (sometimes very different) than when we picked it up. No book has more power to change a person than the Bible. It is Gods Word to man. It should come as no surprise then if people, changed by the purifying words of holy scripture, want to talk about it.\\nCatherine Mackenzie has done us all a great service in compiling a book containing the stories of people impacted by Gods word. I found this book refreshing as a I read the testimonies of people from all walks of life recounting the importance and influence of the Bible in their lives. As Jennifer Grosser, one of the contributors, puts it,  He [God] meets us in the pages of the Bible, at whatever age or spiritual state we are in, and speaks to us there. Indeed, this statement is proven time and again by those whose stories are recorded in the pages of this book. As I read and reread some of the personal accounts, I was reaffirmed in my own experience with Bible.\\nThe entries in this book are short and easy to digest. Even so, they are very encouraging and resound with the greatness of Gods word. I recommend this book to those who are new to the Bible as a travel guide of what blessings you can expect from a life dedicated to reading and studying the Bible. I recommend this book to those who have spent their lives in the Bible as a scrapbook of Gods love and mercy in giving us His holy, inspired word whereby we may know Him.\\nThis book was provided to me by Christian Focus Publications for the purpose of review.

That's typewriting, not typewriters, although a cursory history of the machine is included of necessity. The book highlights the sometimes uneasy relationship between the machine and the machinist, stretching from the early days when both typist and machine were known as 'typewriters'. The book gets a little psychological - a little 'far out' - in the middle, however overall it raises interesting points. Not a waste of time, but likely to appeal only to very specific individuals. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Wrapped In Rain\\nCharles Martin\\nThomas Nelson Publisher\\nChristian Fiction\\n5 Stars\\nWrapped in Rain by Charles Martin is one of those books that is hard to put down. There are times in the book where he seem to stay on one subject for quite a lengthy time but I overlooked that and got into the deepness of the story. The story really revolves around two brothers and their housekeeper along with their alcoholic father. Tucker Mason now well known for his photography has a hard time forgiving his father. Growing up on a vast southern estate he had everything that most boysjust dream of ever having, a big house and acres to roam, but the one thing he was denied was the love of his father. The bottle meant more to him then his son and he grew up in the throngs of hell. With the housekeeper Miss Ella Rain, Tucker learns the meaning of love as she wraps him in her arms. With his younger brother Matthew(Mutt)they grew up going their separate ways,Tucker into Photography and Mutt into a mental hospital. Mutt escapes from the hospital and Tucker is forced to return back home. Here he comes to the point where he has to face his tragic past. Even though she has been gone for a long time he can still recall Miss Ellas words,and hear her prayers.The secret she whispered that he carried with him was; Life is a battle, but you cant fight it with your fists. You got to fight it with your heart.\\nThis is the 3rd book that I have read of Charles Martins and I have to say I enjoyed it as well as the others. It teaches forgiveness, and love and the power that God can have in ones life. One thing I have found with Mr. Martins books is they seem to deal with real life. Even though the characters and novel are fiction.. The book is deep and some may have a hard time getting into it. I have found that novels like this if one read them slower than they usually read they will get a fuller detail of the story.\\nI received this complimentary copy from the Thomas Nelson and their Book Sneeze Bloggers program. A positive review was not required and the opinion of this book is based on my own thoughts of the book ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'The concept of a group of individuals with the power to manipulate reality is interesting and delicate. It has been handled with care here particularly by juxtaposing these great abilities with normally crippling disabilities. Also important in the success of this story are the characters. They are a collection of misfits who are compelling because they have no desire to be all powerful and/or take over the world. The reader quickly empathizes with the characters in their struggles.\\nFirst Stringers was a pretty quick read, but the plot seemed more ideally to fit a series of short stories rather than a novel. Three distinct parts were evident and though all parts were strongly related, there were distinct conclusions and consecutive lulls after the first two parts. The final part included a great deal of action and served as a tense, exciting climax, but the ending was too abrupt with not enough resolution to satisfy the reader. In addition to the uneven pacing the book was riddled with typos that distracted from the story. In my opinion the concept of this story seemed to have great potential, but the execution fell a little short.\\nI felt that this novel was directed at more of a YA reading level. Though the characters are all purportedly adults due to their relatively sheltered lives and disabilities many of them behave much like teenagers. It is largely a novel about self discovery, control, and independence which resonates more strongly with a slightly younger crowd. Adult concepts occasionally arise, but they are often tangential or background to the current events handled by the group.\\nThe focus is more on the characters and their internal struggles rather than their abilities and therefore their abilities seem more like magic than science, especially considering there is little to no explanation regarding the origin of their powers offered. Though the characters are able to accomplish a lot due to their level-headedness during conflicts, not much is made of the intellect and theories set up early on. \\nOverall I did enjoy the story and found myself thinking about it after I had put it down. If you dont get bogged down wanting an explanation for how the powers work/why they got the powers or fill in some of the explanations on your own, First Stringers is a pretty enjoyable read. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Peter has an accident along the road near his house after avoiding running over a cat. He calls into his insurance company and happens to speak with Mina. When he is involved in a second accident just a short while later, he calls his insurance back requesting her specifically. Through the course of helping him out after a second accident in just a short while, Mina learns that he is a widower with young twin daughters approximately the same age as her daughter. She herself is a single mother living in her mother\\'s flat. When her mother moved in with her boyfriend, she left the flat to Mina\\'s care. There she is not only raising her daughter Sal, but her unruly teenage sister as well. When Mina calls Peter at home to let him know that his second accident would not count against him, a quiet over-the-phone friendship begins. They share each other\\'s sorrows despite the distance between Peter\\'s higher education lifestyle and Mina\\'s working class one. Can they also find love?\\nI picked this novel up several times since it first arrived. I think the cover is adorable and I quite liked the coincidence that brought Peter and Mina together in the first place. It was the differences between American English and British English that kept me from reading past the first chapter. It isn\\'t that I couldn\\'t understand what was written (there was some pop culture references and slang that went over my head), but it was the pacing of the language and the colloquialisms that kept tripping me up. For example, when I read something such as \"going to hospital\" instead of \"going to the hospital,\" it makes me stumble. It took me several chapters to get into the flow of things. Once I did, I enjoyed picking up new words and expressions.\\nCrossed Wires is character-based book. It spends a great deal of time developing its characters and telling their story. Despite some fast paced scenes, much of the book focuses specifically on Mina and Peter\\'s internal life and the joys and challenges that surround single parenting. In that, I felt it mirrored life as it actually is. It was more a view of a slice of their lives than it was about any one event or plot line. It never seemed to go anywhere. I was convinced that when Peter took the trip to help Mina out during a crisis that things would start to happen, but I was mistaken. This did frustrate me while reading the novel, but it is precisely the lack of split second drama and over-the-top happenings that make me look back on this novel as fondly as I do. Traveling through the lives of ordinary people at their speed in a book is an interesting way to experience a culture different from your own. I enjoyed Peter\\'s and Mina\\'s story and I can imagine them happily spending the rest of their lives getting to know each other better. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Dash &amp; Lily\\'s Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan is a young adult romance. A red Moleskine notebook passed back and forth between strangers provides the context for sharing desires and dreams. This unique approach sets the book apart from the typical teen novel. The chapters shift point of view from one chapter to the next providing insights into each side of the relationship. \\nThe romance elements and characters were more sophisticated than many YA novels. However, the apparent lack of parents during the holidays seemed rather odd. In addition, the numerous side stories about family and friends sometimes distracted from the core relationship. I wanted to know more about Dash and Lily. However the plot led to a satisfying climax and conclusion. I liked the idea of being locked in the storage room.\\nFrom a techie perspective, I thought the use of the Moleskine notebook provided an interesting contrast to the texting, YouTube, and other high-tech elements. It\\'s fun to imagine where you might hide the book.\\nI found myself imagining all the places where the notebook could be hidden and the different types of dares and dreams that could be featured. I\\'m more of a thriller nerd than a romantic, so I found the codes, clues, and mystery aspect the most fun part of the book. At one point in the middle of the book, I actually thought it would be fun to get rid of the romance with two points of view and send the story toward the \"dark side\" with increasingly dangerous dares... okay, maybe that wouldn\\'t work with the light Christmas theme (tee hee).\\nIt\\'s a great addition to the \"Christmastime\" collection and a great choice for teens who are drawn to the more traditional, light romance.

       "  'comment': \"A few weeks prior to reading this novel, I came across a short chapter in a history book about Theodora. She was a larger than life character that knew how to command an audience. Theodora lived during a tumultuous time. There is not a lot of documentation about this period and a lot of what we know is speculation. I was really interested in reading Stella Duffy's take on the Empress Theodora. \\nTheodora: Actress, Empress, Whore by Stella Duffy depicts Theodora from a young child until her marriage to Justinian I. Theodora's life was not an easy one. As a young girl she was taught to dance, to learn how to turn off her emotions and most of all to survive. Her punishment for misbehaving in her dance lessons sounded torturous. At a young age she was sold to a theater where she began her career as an actress. The title actress was also exchangeable with the title of whore. However life's circumstances did not hinder Theodora from getting what she wanted out of life. In fact some might say she made life play by her rules. \\nI enjoyed the details that Stella Duffy gave to Theodora's life. The author dives into the head of one of the most influential women of ancient Rome and makes her come to life. I appreciated the fact that the author did not hold back from the grittiness and brash life of Constantinople and Theodora. Although there is not explicit sex scenes in this novel, it is spoken of very often. Theodora used her body in what ever way suited her best. Duffy doesn't gloss this issue over.\\nOverall I really like this book. It is an engaging read that will have you wanting to know more about this brazen woman. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'The Nature Principle is one person\\'s belief system and to him it makes sense. To others, it would take a restructuring of their world and how they live to make this work for them. I moved to another country and lived there for ten years, and in those ten years saw people going from \"the nature principle\" way of living to a more materialistic way. As the young people\\'s incomes grew and they had access to more expensive pursuits, the bicycles for one example, once used as a means of transportation was slowly used less and cars were purchased and used by all members of the family (lots of rain added to this covered transportation). Because of that experience, this book was of interest to me as to how we evolve, making choices for our own environment. The author listed seven concepts which, if followed, would help us to reshape our lives. In addition, he gave us a framework to be able to boost our creativity, to promote our health and well being, to build smarter communities and to strengthen human bonds. \\nMy selection was on 8 CD\\'s and this worked for me as I was able to do my morning walk as I listened to the inspiration as explained by Mr. Louv. I recommend this book, but also the CD set highly because I believe we all can contribute more to our small corner of the world to not lose what we have in pursuit of things we do not need. ',\n",

Divided into sections on \"Man-Ape Creatures\" (Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti), \"Sea Monsters\" (Leviathan, Kraken), \"Living Fossils\" (Mylodon, Loch Ness Monster, Mokele-mbembe, Kongamato), each two-page spread gives a cursory overview of the monster being described. Almost as if the authors didn\\'t know quite how to fill the space, a couple of pages are devoted to movies with monster tie-ins. With the abundance of cheesy and sensationalized photos and Xtreme Facts, consider this book the cheesepuff of your folk- and fairytale collection: empty calories, but fun to indulge in occasionally. \\n ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Vidarian is summoned to meet with the priestess of air, Endera. Endera feels his family history and his ship make him perfect for her task at hand. When Vidarian refuses the job of taking a fire priestess on his wooden ship in the ocean through dangerous waters Endera invokes the commitment made by his grandfather 50 years ago binding Vidarian to the journey. Endera being of good graces will still pay him handsomely though. The fire priestess is being transported because she is being sought after by Vkortha, dangerous telepaths who live on their own island where no one knows except the fire priestess Ariadel. Vidarian will learn more of fire magic, water magic, and himself than he ever thought possible as a lone sailor. Will the fire goddess go beyond normal doings to help the priestess Araidel and Vidarian? Or is there more at stake here? Even the griffins are willing to help Vidarian believing he is the one to close the gate.\\nThis is one full fantasy read with a journey and world all created new here. This world created is one full of the four elements, and the space between them. The space being chaos and/or connection of the elements. For each of the four elements there are priestesses. But the magic has been dieing out over the years. Even with the crossing of the elements in bloodlines it's created a disease that could kill the children and young adults if more than one flares to life inside them. Even the griffins are of different elements. And this world aspect I really enjoyed. Even the mythology in setting up the gate, and chaos. But what lies behind the gates might be able to help the world or flip it completely upside down from what they know it as.\\nThe characters where interesting in the way they handle the occurrences they go through. Their where a few things about the characters I didn't understand though. One was Vidarian wanting to be bond the emeralds he is paid from Endera to his life. I think I missed something here as the emeralds will die out when he passes on. I would think he would want them to spend not to look at, but I'm not him. And the love between Vidarian and Ariadel seemed to happen awfully fast for me. Unless there was something with the bonding to the emeralds that connected them (which I'm thinking happened) it seemed they fell in 'love' to quickly for me. But as a couple I like them together.\\nThis book seems to be the start of a bigger series. To me the first half of the book was set up of the characters and arranging the world for us. I felt from time to time there where things said by the characters or happenings that posed huge questions in my mind that instantly made me feel lost. The answers did come through shortly after, but when I read them at first I felt there was not set up for it to me and had me lost. The second half of the book read easier for me and the action picked up. We also got more of the back story answers here for the world and creatures and characters.\\nI think I read the synopsis of the book and was trying to relate some of that to what I was reading and had a hard time. As the information about Vidarian's grandfather marrying a fire priestess doesn't come out until the very end of the book. Along with other details of the world and the different magics not living peacefully blended together in bloodlines. I like this idea, but kind of wish it was presented earlier in the book.\\nI'm very curious to see where the next book in the series goes. I think this could be a good series, but a shaky start for me. But these are my thoughts and could have just been my timing in reading it wasn't right. Please if you like the sounds of the book, go give it a try you just might like it. I really wanted to loooove this book, as I only liked it. I would like to give book two a chance to see where this great world goes.\",\n",

       "  'comment': \"According to the verbiage on the back of the book, the author struck a deal with spirits from the constellation, Sirius, while making his way through the Himalayas. These spirits led him on an enlightening adventure, the result of which was his learning how to make love to the universe, which he is now sharing with the world.\\nQuite honestly, if you've done any reading regarding Sirian Prophecies or on spirituality where love is the main force that will heal the world and its people, then you've probably read most of what's in here already. It's not that the book is particularly awful, but there wasn't anything new or earth shattering about it. If you've not read anything like this before, then it's definitely worth a read, if only to see how someone believes that love can bring about global change and enlightenment. If you're prone to call this sort of thing airy fairy hippie crap, then don't even bother with it.\\nGenerally, each chapter begins by sharing a part of the author's journey, where he meets certain babas (people). None are identified by name, but by features that are prominent to the author. After the short story of a portion of the journey comes a focused discussion of aspects the author wishes to highlight regarding how the mind can be the source of dis-ease for your body and mind as well as the world. The chapter is then wrapped up with a very short transition to the next chapter, which runs in much the same manner.\\nWhat is interesting to note is that though the author's story contains many babas who are on the path of enlightenment, very few are perfect in any way, which is refreshing to see. Some are very well along their path and have very enlightened outlooks and loving demeanors, but still have work to do on other aspects of their process towards ascension. This is one major difference from some books where you'll meet a master who is so far along, that he or she, seemingly, has no flaws at all and only exists to dispense platitudes and advice. To be sure, there are platitudes and advice to be had in the book, but the beings they come from are far from perfect.\\nAll in all, Make Love to the Universe is a pleasant enough read if you can get passed the author referring to himself in the plural throughout the book (the reason for this is explained early on). There are lessons to be learned here if you've not heard them before and, for the most part, the author does not come across as sanctimonious nor arrogant. Each reader's mileage will vary according to their personal investment already put in towards love and light. \",\n",

When a story develops, Cork and his elder daughter, Jenny, are separated from the other membersof the family. They end up on one of the many islands on the Lake of The Woods in Minnesota, on the U.S. Canadian border.\\nJenny arrives first and hears the faint whimper of a baby. Later, she discovers a body of a young woman who had been murdered. The woman showed signs of torture and Jenny assumes that the woman was the baby\\'s mother.\\nAs Jenny and Cork ponder their rescue, they wonder who killed the girl and what to do if the killer returns.\\nNot only a mystery, this is a story of good against evil. Cork\\'s sister-in-law, Rosa and her husband have a strong faith but there are a number of times that these characters and others have to question that faith and God\\'s purpose in what was happening in the story.\\nThe story is rich in American Indian history. Cork is part Ojibwe and can relate to other American Indians, however, Cork\\'s son, Stephen, demonstrates his spirituality and communication ability wonderfully. The other American Indians seem to feel his spirituality and love of Indian history and traditions.\\nI read the story compulsively and enjoyed the well described characters while wondering how they would escape their situation. The twis the author provided, added to the intelligence of the story and the satisfaction with the conclusion. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Vergas work is associated with the realism of the late 19th century and most of his stories depict the simple and harsh life of Sicilian peasants. This collection is named for his story Cavalleria Rusticana, mostly known in the English-speaking world for Mascagnis opera of the same name. The actual story (the opera was based on Vergas dramatic adaptation) is quite short, a quick tale of adultery and violence. These often appear in Vergas other stories, along with poverty and privation. A couple stories betray Vergas familiarity with upper class life  Picturesque Lives has its narrator reminiscing about visiting a small village with an unnamed woman, How, when and why is about an affair amongst the wealthy.\\nMost of the stories are fairly involving but the more memorable ones tend to be the extended narratives  the early Nedda, about a farm laborer considered poor even by comparison to the other girls, whose brief happiness is destroyed by conventional morality, Jeli the Shepherd, a leisurely depiction of the life of a good-natured and poor shepherd who never forgets his childhood sweetheart but who meets a bad ending, and Rosso Malpelo which follows a nasty, unhappy miner who also comes to a bad end. Of the shorter stories, The She-Wolf  an intense depiction of a voracious man-eater  and the feverish Wolf-hunt  another one about adultery  were probably the most memorable. As is often mentioned, Verga succeeds in giving his poor characters dignity without, for the most part, romanticizing or sentimentalizing their plight. ',\n",

She goes on to note that while government propaganda is rampant in China, it is more subtle in America and comes more from media and advertisers than directly from the government. Her thoughts on entrepreneurship, innovation, and globalization were also noteworthy. I would highly recommend this book to others, particularly to those with great ideas who need a push to pursue their dreams. ',\n",

Tables upon tables, interspersed by charts and sentence fragments, almost devoid of a narrative.\\nIt's such a shame, as this could could be a great book. Someone like Mark Kurlanski or Michael Pollan could re-write it into a gripping story, but whatever the skills of Du Vall, she seems to fall short in the writing department.\\nIt's an impressive book to be able to pull out of the bookshelf in order to settle an argument, but I'm not really sure to what extent I'd trust its contents.\\nIt looks like Mme du Vall was a bit too credulous and inclusive in her selection of sources. The only explicitly false story I found was that of Otto Titzling, where she apparently took Wallace Rayburns book at face value, but after that I trust the rest of the data a whole lot less.\\nThere are also lots of minor typos, that should have been caught by editors. She puts the invention of the Croissant at the siege of Vienna, which while technically not true is commonly accepted, however, she moves that event to 1863!\\nAnd she calls the inventor of the aga stove Gustaf Galen, when it should be Gustaf Daln.\\nSure, these are probably typos, but they mean that little of the information can be taken at face value, which kind of reduces the value of such an information-packed book. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'If you have ever felt that celebrities are given far too many privileges, or that they very often tend to expound enthusiastically  and with such conviction of their authority on the subject  on matters of national import, then you would probably enjoy this book. If youve ever wondered at the cruelty of the press in reporting on celebrity lifestyles, this book would probably strike a chord.\\nMarina Hyde manages to be extremely funny, while making some very serious points. Certain celebrities come in for more exposure than others  such as Tom Cruise, Sharon Stone, Angelina Jolie and Britney Spears (in Britneys case, Hyde discusses the relentless and disgraceful hounding of the star when she was in the midst of a breakdown  and recalls instances such as when a paparazzi photographer put a camera up Britneys skirt and photographed the menstrual blood on her knickers, subsequently printing same as evidence that she wasnt pregnant). She is withering towards Jolie, citing the time when Angelina and Brad decided to have their first biological child in Namibia. What wasnt widely reported at the time was how journalists wishing to enter the country during the couples stay were told that they would need to seek written permission from Angelina and Brad before entering. How on earth did we get to the stage where two film stars are allowed to dictate who enters a country? And how was it ever allowed for civilians in that country to have their homes searched for evidence of photographs of the couple?\\nWhy does Elmo from Sesame Street get invited to speak at the UN Congress? Yes, Elmo is a puppet. Who got invited to speak at UN Congress! If this happened in a satirical novel, the reader would probably dismiss it as a stupid storyline, but it actually happened.\\nHyde also discusses the dangers of celebrities wading into areas of which they have little knowledge (witness Sharon Stone talking about how she beat cancer through lifestyle alone  a dangerous message to send to other cancer sufferers), and how the rise in celebrity adoptions from developing countries (as in the cases of Angelina Jolie and Madonna) have actually led to more children being left in orphanages in such countries.\\nMy favourite chapter was the one about celebrity magazines  I have a personal dislike of such publications as Closer, Reveal, New, etc. as they seem fixated on celebrities weight, and love to speculate wildly and without any basis in fact about the lives of people in the public eye.\\nDespite all this, the book remains full of humour and made me laugh out loud on a number of occasions, and I would absolutely recommend it.

       "  'comment': \"It's like Liberal Facism's mean little sister. In his effort to be treatise for the everyman, Levin dispenses historical investigation and simply gives broad generalizations which are to serve as adequate background for his reader. Therefore, instead of seeking to see how liberals came to prefer statism as a proper interpretation of American governance, he essentially informs his readers that liberals came to their conclusions via ignorance and self-serving vices. \\nDismissively characterizing liberals on his self-defined moral high-ground, Levin encourages his reader not to be passive in political discussion in the public and private spheres (read: fervently engage liberals wherever you meet them). It is this combination that really makes Levins work horrible. He never equips his readers with any means of respecting the liberal they will be encountering when they follow his advice. Without a sense of shared values and empathy towards one another, what would any dialogue between a Levin-trained conservative and liberal ever result in other than more polarization? \\nOh, and Levin mentions religion quite a bit, but ultimately for Levin, it is the tradition of unchecked market forces which will redeem society. I suggest Levin read the Popes 2009 encyclical Charity in Truth while readers looking for a critical, yet historically researched view of modern liberalism to read Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism. Ironically, Goldberg's detailed look at liberal history tells his readers that liberals are worthy enough to spend the time to honestly study. Levin doesn't seem to believe that's the case. \",\n",

The terrorists are angry and looking to make a dramatic statement. Sleeper cells are waking up all over the United States, and bombs are going off in very public places. Riley is supposed to be starting mini-camp for the Colorado Mustangs, but that is becoming more unlikely. Following an attack on Riley and his friends before mini-camp, and the death of Riley's father by a terrorists bomb, Riley decides to take on the terrorists personally. \\nI did not read the first novel in this series, but enjoyed Blown Coverage. Despite the way the cover portrayed the book to me (as a football novel), I was pleased to discover that it was an interesting thriller. Riley did not have to be a football player for the plot to work, and the game was not integral to the plot. I didn't connect to the characters the way I would have liked. They were likable, but I did not find many similarities between myself and them. The relationship between Riley and Khadi annoyed me. They either need to be together or let each other go. \\nOverall, this was an entertaining book, great for an easy weekend read. I do not feel compelled to read more in the series, but am glad I read this one.\",\n",

Let me quickly add that such a harsh assessment is not true of these stories. (Well, not most of them. There are a few) Jack Vance did not reach the heights he has by being a hackneyed purveyor of retread Dungeons and Dragons stories. But, when the collection is composed primarily of these, and you have a natural aversion to the sub-genre, it is difficult to approach the stories on their own merit. Accordingly, I got tired. There were only so many times I could slog my way into another story where I had to figure out whatever nomenclature was being used for this world  a slogging that detracted from the enjoyment of the underlying story.\\nAnd, in spite of my rant above, there are quality underlying stories. The Dragon Masters and The Last Castle are deserved award winners. And other classics reside herein also. However, there are (as can often happen in Best Of collection) some duds  stories that were an endurance test rather than a joy. That Jack Vance can write is undisputed. Whether one wants to have a steady diet of Jack Vance falls much more to the individual taste. I found enjoyment in some of these stories in the past, but reading them all together this time only resulted in a distraction from that joy. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Lessons from a dead girl is a unusual read. I read this book a few months ago and i still can\\'t quite it it out of my mind. I enjoyed to sincerity and honesty that it portrayed. It truly describes the struggle Laine must face after the \"experiments\" practiced in the doll closet. It hits close to home for most girls, the sexual tension between the girls (or rather more for Laine then Leah) is very believeable. I\\'m sure many people can relate to Laine, she feels \"gross\" and used. The times in the doll closet really tear her apart on the inside. I enjoyed her insicirites, (did i spell that right?) and how her new friends helped her overcome the deep secret inside. \\nI also enjoyed Leah\\'s part in the story. From the very beginning she is vindictive and twisted. Being the cool kid in the class she is admired by everyone. Yet, she also faces inner struggles like Laine. I can understand her reasoning for the doll closet experiments, i think deep dpwn she only wanted someone who could share her inner pain. That someone was Laine, even though it alomost destroyed Laine, i think Leah\\'s character was crucial to this story and i wouldnt have changed her at all. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Changing Tomorrow 2 outlines an entire unit plan for teachers on the theme of leadership, with lesson plans that include in-depth study of several famous leaders, including Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, Pablo Picasso, Charles Darwin and more. Students are asked, through a series of lessons and projects, to learn more about each person and assess the ways in which each does or does not exemplify the qualities of leadership. This leaves a lot of room for class discussion and critical thinking because even though all of the people included in the book are exemplary in many ways, even great humans have their flaws and their detractors. The lesson plans in the book encourage students to ponder whether a person's positive contributions to society outweigh their bad decisions, or whether it is even necessary for them to do so in order for us to rightly admire them as great leaders.\\n \\nVanTassel and Avery also include helpful explanations of how their unit plan aligns with U.S. common core state standards in gifted education, 21st-century skills and English Language Arts. For Canadian educators I can also attest that these lesson plans could easily be applied to Canadian provincial outcomes in English Language Arts and Social Studies. In Nova Scotia, for instance, the junior high (middle school) Social Studies curriculum focuses on the idea of empowerment, so these lessons would fit easily into that theme.\\nI found this book to be well laid out, straight forward and easy to use. And of course, as always, I asked my resident curriculum expert--my partner Mike, the junior high English and Social Studies teacher--to help me assess the book's value. We ended up spending two days discussing the lives and legacies of some of the people featured in the book, thereby inadvertently completing some of the assignments recommended for high ability students.\\nIn a way, that's its own endorsement!\\nDisclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for the purposes of writing a review, though the review did not necessarily need to be favourable, just honest. I frequently read and review books for this reason, but I am always very truthful (and, I hope, fair) in my reviews. Therefore any opinions expressed are strictly my own (except in the case of educational resource books, in which case I often consult other educators to help me assess the books, which I usually mention in my reviews). \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Robin is a 25 years old guy without a meaning in his life. He hasn't had a good example from his mother, a single mom who lived on welfare for the most part of Robin's life and then she married a wealthy man. Actually Robin didn't have a bad life, his step-father also volunteered to pay for his tuition, only that Robin doesn't know what he want from life. Personal relationships didn't help, since he was always treated like a boy-toy, probably since he never gave the impression to be more than a pretty face. Anyway Robin is not a bad guy, he is very sensitive, and easy to be hurt... he is not a true negative character, he maybe only need a push toward the right direction, and perhaps a firm hand and more attention of what he has received till now.\\nKipp is a more than 40 years old Republican senator. He always wanted to be a politician, he came from a family of politician, and since his family was from the Republican party, he himself joined than wing. But Kipp is also gay and he needed to hide his true identity; so he married a woman through a mutual agreement, a woman who was aware of the fact that the marriage would be only a cover. Nine years later, Kipp is tired to hide himself, and his wife has started to regret all the thing she gave up for money. When Kipp meets Robin, he is ready to risk his career and all his money for a piece of heaven.\\nEven if Kipp is actually a cheating man, he is not so bad... I like how he faces his errors and how he puts in danger himself to not deny who he is and who he loves. Above all I like that he never lets Robin down, he never chooses the easy way if it means to make suffer Robin. Robin is always his first thought.\\nRobin maybe is not a fully grown man. He is the fledgling of a possible good man, but he needs time to metabolize and probably he needs to be forced to face the real life. I don't know if Kipp is good to him, since Robin needs to be shacked and firmly directed, and instead Kipp tends to protect and hide him from the sharp edge of life.\\nThen there is Louise, Kipp's wife. She should be the negative character in the story, but well, she is too pathetic to be wicked. She is not so better than Robin, since I believe also she is childish and immature. Sometime, instead of hate her, I feel pain for her. And her partner in crime, Alonso... well, probably he is the most unbelievable character of all, so unbelievable to be almost funny!\\nSo yes, another romance by G.A. Hauser where no one of the characters pass the test to be the perfect romance hero, and yet another romance that I read in one session, another page turning book that took me glued to the screen to see what it happened next. And with this one I also realized that it's not even an erotic thing, since the erotic scenes are not enough detailed or graphic to be considered the main event of the story... And so I realized, after I don't know how many books by this author, that it's truly the plot and the characters that hold me enraptured.\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/160202099X/?tag=elimyrevandra-20\",\n",

At least it was until I discovered this book. \\nRation: The Simple codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking has been an absolute revelation to me. It's as if everything I hated about cooking has been cleared away and now I can be ME in the kitchen. Why? Because I won't be spending untold hours sifting through reecipe web sites or countless cookbooks trying to find a recipe that looks as if it would embody the flavors on the tip of my tongue and running around in my head wishing for me to express them. Thanks to Mr Ruhlman now I KNOW how to translate the flavor/texture wishes into something I can eat.\\nI've actually paused my reading of this book a little over half way through because I'm so excited to get in the kitchen and COOK! No looking for recipes or buying prepackaged mixes because I can do this. Me! I can walk confidently into my kitchen, pull out the basics I never used and put them to work.\\nFirst up was a gnocchi browned in butter and roasted garlic topped with a sauce of roma tomatoes and spinach. YUM!!!\\nNow I will read the remaining sections as I need them. If you've ever wished you knew how to just walk in the kitchen and make something, no mixes, no recipes, this is the book you need. My copy has a permanent place next to the stove. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'Once upon a time there was a man called Bodkin who wanted to live forever because he enjoyed everything about his life. So he went to see the Wise Woman who sends him to the Old Man of the Forest. That old man tells him he will live until all the trees are cut, but Bodkin realizes that will happen one day and he wants to live forever. So he goes to the Old Man of the Lake who will live until he drinks the whole lake -- which is an endpoint. Then to the Old Man of the Mountain who will live until the mountain stands no more. Bodkin is satisfied with that and stays... for several hundred years. But then he feels a longing for his old village and wants to go back. The old man warns him it will be changed and whatever happens he must not leave the saddle of his horse. Bodkin agrees. His old village is definitely gone -- in its place is a modern city with skyscrapers and traffic lights. On his way back he comes across an old man with a broken-down wagon and dozens of pairs of old shoes scattered across the road. The old man begs for help. Bodkin hesitates, then dismounts to pick up the shoes. He then asks who the old man is why he carries so many worn-out shoes. \"The old man smiled, and his eyes glistened greedily as he laid a soft hand on Bodkin\\'s arm. \\'I am Death,\\' he whispered. \\'And these are the shoes I have worn out running after you.\\'\\nPairs nicely with Colin Thompson\\'s How to Live Forever and Appointment by Somerset Maugham (pic bk version) -- Tuck Everlasting, etc.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Catching Crazy by Jacob Cummer\\nPublisher: Fullproof Publishing, 2009\\nPages: 13\\nISBN: 978-0-9822326-4-4\\nSource: LibraryThing giveaway\\nThurman is a sixth grader trying to figure out what normal is. His parents are divorced and his dog is missing. He deals with things by clowning around. All he wants is for things to be normal again. But, what is normal? This is something he will learn from his neighbor. Harlan is the one-legged man, who sits in his front yard everyday, smoking his pipe. Rumor is, you dont want to get to close to him because you might catch his crazy.\\nWhen Thurmans dog goes missing he asks his neighbor if he has seen his dog. Harlan tells him he hasnt and offers him a job. With money being tight since the divorce, Thurman has no choice but to take Harlan up on his job offer if he want to have a brand new baseball glove. Harlans idea of a job is to have Thurman sit and visit with him, talking about all kinds of things, occasionally reading to him or refilling his glass of tea. At the end of each work day, Harlan has a question for Thurman to ponder. It is through these questions that Thurman gets the answers to the questions in his heart. These answers start filling in the gaps in his life. He also realizes that if people had tried to get to know the old man they would have realized he wasnt crazy. There was always a good reason for the things he did. This book was very good. It was an emotional read that made me cry. I told my mother about the book, read her some excerpts and cried again. I give this a 5 out of 5 rating. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Author: Dina Silver\\nPublished by: CreateSpace \\nAge Recommended: YA - Adult\\nReviewed By: Arlena Dean\\nBook Blog For: GMTA\\nRating: 5\\nReview:\\n\"One Pink Line\" by Dina Silver was full of romance and family saga contemporary read that was indeed enjoyable. It was a little predictable to me but it still was a good read that kept me reading till the end. I will say it\\'s about a young lady who makes a mistake, ends up pregnant and her life choices she will have to live with. \"One Pink Line\" could be a very real novel due to the excellent work of this author you are able to see into the minds and emotions of the two main characters. \"One Pink Line\" presents a story of Sydney and Grace\\'s intertwining journey toward love, loss, acceptance, second chances and redemption.\" This author provides you with a good detailed description of both of these characters journeys. Be ready to many twist and turns that will only keep you interested as you continue turning the pages wanting to know what will happen next in their lives and OMG was a surprise at the end.

The laotong, Snow Flower, introduces herself by sending Lily a silk fan on which shes painted a poem in nu shu, a unique language that Chinese women created in order to communicate in secret, away from the influence of men. As the years pass, Lily and Snow Flower send messages on fans, compose stories on handkerchiefs, reaching out of isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.

       "  'comment': \"There's something to be said for firsts, even if the only thing to be said there is that you can probably get a book out of that first if it's notable enough. Fortunately, that's not all that Jake Adelstein has going for him in Tokyo Vice - the story itself is also quite good. Adelstein was the first white reporter for the Japanese edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the biggest and most prestigious newspaper in Japan. Adelstein takes us from his first moment of deciding to try to join the newspaper and the employment process, through learning to be a police reporter in Saitama, before moving into Tokyo and taking on life in the big city. There's a good amount in here in the early parts of people reacting to this white Jewish guy from Missouri showing up as a reporter, but as Adelstein gets more accustomed to his job, the stories of being a reporter and the more lurid side of Japan come forward more. And in the end, Adelstein ends up pursuing a story regarding the #1 yakuza in Japan at the time, and his work leads him to receive death threats. (Note: this is the prologue of the book, and thus not a spoiler.)\\nA lot of this sounds fairly typical of these sorts of guy-makes-the-beat-and-then-gets-in-over-his-head stories, I suppose, but it's really done well here, and there are a lot of details that make the story quite fascinating, at least if you're interested in Japan stuff. The workplace scenes at the newspaper at the beginning, as he learns about his coworkers and how things are done, how to build up contacts and what goes into keeping them are well-observed, and then later on, when we hear about life in the Tokyo red-light district, it's sobering and harsh, but presented clearly and with the viewpoint of the police contact telling Adelstein about it. I have to say, I really did quite like the writing. It had a lot of impact - funny when it was supposed to be, disturbing and horrifying on call, and then always clear. As I suppose befits a journalist.\\nIt sounds odd to say, but I liked a lot of the characters (or real people) in the book, and particularly Adelstein's mentor, and the Alien Cop. But I really did like the way Adelstein himself slowly and subtly changed over the course of the book, from someone who was doing this because it seemed interesting and he wanted a job in Japan, but whose Japanese wasn't really that great and was clearly an outsider, to someone who knew lots of the connections in organized crime and became so part of Japan that he couldn't really go undercover as a foreigner anymore. And it helps, then, this dual inside/outside status, when he gets involved in investigations of human trafficking in the last parts of the book - the real, horrible record of it in Japan, and his connection to and feelings towards the women involved leading to breaking him down, and roughening his methods. It's all well done, and informative.\\nOn the whole, Tokyo Vice was a fairly fast, engaging read, with a good amount of informative kick, and an interesting, ground-breaking lead to follow. It's definitely worth a read if you're into Japan stuff, or if you like newspaper or crime stories. There's a lot here to offer, and while it's not always enjoyable, I don't think you'd regret trying it. \",\n",

The history is solid, and covers both the institutional side (how the Hall and museum came to be built, maintained, and ruled) and the election of the players (and others) who are honored there.\\nJames uses a variety of methods to determine the \"value\" of the players, and ultimately concludes:\\n* The Hall has no actual standards.\\n* The BBWA (the baseball writers) has consistently done better than the various Veterans\\' Committees, however composed.\\n* It\\'s been too late to \"fix\" the Hall (whatever you mean by that) since either 1946 or 1949, depending on how you ask the question.\\nMuch discussion about Phil Rizzuto and Don Drysdale, here, and considerable information about George Davis. Other individual players are discussed in less detail, though some are quite vividly portrayed.\\nThis book\\'s methods (and, more generally, methodology) have largely been adopted by other analysts. The rating systems defined here are displayed on the Baseball-Reference player pages, which has led to their widespread adoption in the baseball analysis community.\\nGreat book. Badly needs an update to cover the past 15 years.\\nThis review has also been published on a dabbler\\'s journal. ',\n",

       "  'comment': \"Being the huge Lord of the Rings fan that I am, I've taken it upon myself to read more about Tolkien and his influences. Quite conveniently, I already have a vast collection of books about Tolkien and his influences, most of which I've dipped into over the years, but never actually sat down to read from cover to cover.\\nAt the end of last year I read Tolkien's biography and his Letters. Book 6 of this year was The Road to Middle-earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien created a new mythology by T.A. Shippey. It's one of the several that I'd dipped into in the past, but it's always seemed a bit too academic to just sit and read for fun.\\nI found it much more interesting that I was expecting it to. At first glance it had looked a little bit dry and dusty, but it was really interesting. In fact, there were bits of it, dealing with old languages and Tolkien's influences in that respect, which seemed quite relevant to the linguistics course that I'm doing. I wish I'd marked the pages while I was reading it because I think some of them could be used in future essays.\\nI did struggle to get into it a little at the beginning. The end, too, was a little heavy going and I did find myself scanning ahead to later pages to see whether it was going to continue in the same vein for a long time. The middle bit was wonderful though. I got through it really quickly, mainly because I didn't want to put it down.\\nMy main complaint with this book, perhaps other editions are better (mine is different to the one pictured above), is that it needs some serious editing. There were some pretty obvious typos that should have been caught, not just minor things either, some really bad things like half a sentence being printed twice at the end of a paragraph.\\nShippey makes really valid and interesting points, but he has a very round-about way of saying things. He's clearly really knowledgeable about what he's writing about but some paragraphs and sentences sound rather clumsy. I know I'm hardly one to talk, but as I was reading, I was mentally correcting some sentences to make them sound 'right' in my head.\\nDespite this, it was a really worthwhile read, one which I would recommend to anyone interested in Tolkien's influences and how The Lord of the Rings came into being. \",\n",

When Flash takes a picture of the villagers with his instant camera, they are frightened by the bright light of the flash that they mistake for gunfire. When the paper feeds out of the camera and their image appears, they see it as magic and are awestruck at how they can be in two places at once. When Flash explains the process of photography, their fear turns into excitement as they all want to be photographed. With only 9 pictures remaining, how will Flash decide who will be photographed? This fun story makes you appreciate the magic of photography by experiencing it for the first time through the eyes of uncivilized people. The characters are not well developed, but the plot drives the story with its fresh approach to a view of a technology that we take for granted. Elementary school readers may find it hard to believe that someone has never seen a photograph, but it would bridge conversation to culture and people of remote parts of the world who are really not exposed to the same technology.

       "  'comment': \"Background: The great great great great grand nephews of the famous Edgar Allan Poe are Edgar and Allan Poe, twins that share his love of the dark, creepy, and unusual. They are also quite unusual themselves, while twins, and really two separate people, they are interchangeable, and share one mind. They know what the other one knows instantly, as soon as his brother learns, and there is a secret organization that seems to be after them.\\nReview: The Tell Tale Start was a great listen. At a three hour length on audiobook, it wasn't too long or too short and kept my attention the whole way through. Edgar and Allan are two characters but they are one, they do everything together and are almost exactly the same. They are funny and sarcastic and always keep people one their toes. They were witty and fun and that is what made this book great. The plot was not super anxiety ridden or suspenseful, but had a good pace and flowed very well. This is a wonderful start to a fun series for middle-graders. I think that parents will be happy to know that the Poe boys are smart and they are good role models for being educated, but maybe a little too smart making them often troublemakers. Too smart for their own good almost.\\nI thought it was a great combination and I am excited for this series to continue.\\nRecommended for Middle Grade readers both boys and girls should enjoy it. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"This is not that great of a book. It's an undemanding, interesting read - perfect for the beach - but it's not especially well or tightly written, and there are some plot holes that seriously effect the story's believability.\\nThere are a number of little irritating things that go on: the sisters look a lot alike and then they don't; Lila's horse doesn't like carrots and then she does; Ellie can never remember how many minutes passed before something happened. This is stuff that should've been tightened up or better explained. Rather important details get held back just until they're necessary to advance the plot, with the result that it feels like Richmond set out without knowing herself who the murderer was going to be.\\nThere are also two fairly serious problems with the narrative. One is that the denouement and the solution to the mystery are revealed in a clunky, expository monologue that goes on for pages and pages, given by a character with an indistinct, not especially believable voice. I suppose this gives the reader the same sort of let-down feeling that Ellie gets from it; the whole monologue pulls the reader out of the story, though, and seems to me to be an unnecessary attempt to humanize the culprit in a way that doesn't feel organic to the story. The second, a plot hole big enough to drive a truck through, is the identity of the murderer. The person responsible was turned up in the initial investigation, and, after very little digging two decades after the fact, is revealed to have a connection with the victim. It's unbelievable that the police would not have run such a lead down, and unbelievable that if they had they wouldn't have found what they were looking for twenty years earlier.\\nIt's a quick and easy read, and the story's not uninteresting, but the mystery could have been better-constructed, and the writing could have been tightened up a lot. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Ender's Game was simply amazing. I had my doubts and put off reading this book for the longest time. Hardcore science fiction is hit or miss for me, but from the very first chapter I knew Ender's Game was going to be phenomenal.\\nSince Ender is a genius, he speaks like an adult. I had to constantly remind myself he was only between the ages of 6 and 11 for the bulk of the book. The same went for all of the children, in a lesser degree. It wasn't annoying. If anything, it made his situation seem more realistic always having to force myself to think of him as a child.\\nBooks about aliens are usually more miss than hit for me, but Ender's Game focused almost solely on humankind. Ender and the other children's time at battle school and commander school was made to feel realistic by showing a completion between them. Ender always being one of the kids, but apart from them could be easily compared to a any everyday situation of the outcast kid at school. Ender considering the adults to be against him or toying with him can also be translated into real life.\\nWhile I saw many messages throughout the novel, none took over. The book never because a form of propaganda, which I thoroughly appreciated. More than anything else, this book was Ender's story. You rejoiced at his accomplishments and fretted over his well-being. By the end of the book, he was very real to me. He had become my friend and my hero. Ender's Game is an extraordinary book. \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'This magazine is currently the same age as myself  31 years; and in May of 1980, F&amp;SF had been in publication 31 years! \\nAmazing how in David Hardy\\'s rendition for \"The Merry Men of Methane\", the Stardust ship looks like an electric smokeless cigarette, or maybe a pot-bat, even with nodules. The native is going to bust it up good with his big stone club.\\nThe only author I recognized was Asimov, and he only wrote an essay on world population, which wasn\\'t too interesting, but would be interesting to compare with the population of today.\\nR.M. Lamming is a woman. I knew instinctively that I would not like her story, \"The Ink Imp\", despite her Oxford background. Seldom do I like female prose. It was a dark and really depressing story, somewhat obscene (imp testicles are fondled), and ended with her character proclaiming himself superior and judging his cynical brother inferior. The moral is that caffeine fueled cynicism creates degenerate and asinine literature and leads to madness and demonic activity. I argue that female prose does do those things, at least in this case. I couldn\\'t help but think that the entire story was a jib at her rather pessimistic male companion, whom, I gather from the story, was interrupting her writing with his friskiness. \\nStephen Tall\\'s \"The Merry Men of Methane\" was part of his \"Stardust\" series. I thought it was a bit of an outdated juvenile adventure, just barely entertaining enough to keep you progressing through it.\\nBob Leman\\'s \"Window\" didn\\'t really make an impression on me until its surprising and somewhat disturbing plot twist, which I rather liked. The story was inventive to say the least. I thought the ending could have been better thought out, as it wasn\\'t too clear. I rate it as third best story in the issue.\\nKeith Roberts \"The Comfort Station\" was really good, but in an annoying way. I rather think there is something deeply Freudian within the story - too deep to fully understand. I believe the major communication here is that man would rather enjoy an unreal and idealized woman rather than a material one, whose natural curiosity always drives her to do such annoying things as to try to save man from himself; to psychologically evaluate man, and tell him of her finding of faults. Curiosity killed the cat. I think the main character, known only as \"the attendant\", not only speaks to those men that society would label as submissive males (they are certainly not alpha males) but also, the attendant really is defining all idealizing males in their immature states. Reality sees these males adapt to the opposite sex and evolve into new creatures or face the fruitless future of the attendant, with his sacred picture book of the feminine and candle. The latter become sort of bizarre aesthetic disciples of femininity; often, by strange metamorphosis, transforming themselves into that which they worship but do not desire. I think this same strange manifesting principle is at work on all things. Anyhoo, I rate this story as second best in the collection. \\nJohn Shirley\\'s \"Eludes A Bride\" is my favorite. He gives us bawdy masculine humor in its finest form. I really think Shirley is somewhat of a Rabelaisian genius. I wonder what else he has written?\\nKaren G. Jollie\\'s \"Bunny-Eyes\" is the perfect example of why I despise the products of female writers (Agatha Christie excluded).\\nI\\'m always somewhat annoyed by the non-story departments of F&amp;SF. Budrys article was OK though. Swarles article on films was putting on airs. ',\n",

Alais is only 9 years old at the time, but she is sent away to live in a convent in England until she is of marriageable age.\\nAt fourteen years of age, Alais is brought to Winchester Castle to meet her betrothed, and to be presented to the King and gain his approval for the marriage. She is under the wing of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who becomes something of a mother to Alais, and the only one that Alais has ever known, her own mother having died during her birth.\\nSoon after Alais turns against her adoptive mother Eleanor and betrothed Richard, and turns towards King Henry, becoming his mistress.\\nThis story was fairly well-developed, the characters of Alais and Eleanor were relatively well fleshed out. Probably the main issue is that, as I get back into reading and try different genres, I find that historical fiction is probably not the best genre for me. I always find myself a little bored. It just doesn\\'t give me that \"edge of my seat\" thrill that I seek when reading. However this is absolutely no fault of the author.\\nSo I would say that if you like historical fiction, then you would probably really enjoy this story and should give it a go. Me? I enjoyed it, but I didn\\'t love it. ',\n",

Mercy has always lived with her insane grandmother and stern, overbearing grandfather because her mother died giving birth. During her eighteenth summer, Mercy meets Trout and suddenly her world opens up. But she also knows that her grandfather will never approve of Trout who is a migrant worker, picking tomatoes, more commonly known as a mater migrant. \\nThus begins the story of Mercy Heron in The Killing Tree by Rachel Keener, a beautifully written, lyrical ode to Appalachia and what it means to live and survive there. The writing is so fluid and so powerful that it is hard to believe this is a debut novel. Clearly the author is familiar with her subject. I didnt just read about Mercy, I lived with her, I felt her joy and her pain. When Mercy worked in the fields picking maters, the description was so intense I felt I worked alongside her. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves the beauty of the printed word. ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Writing is very evocative, but, for me, disquieting. The restoration of hope and healing that flows through this book ought to be uplifting. But I found that it dangerous in the source of this restoration. The post modern yearning for spirituality and the numinous is attracted to this idea of the ongoing of life after death and the hope that it brings. However, it is less willing to submit to the idea that that hope needs a foundation. There is no foundation offered here, and that makes it a false hope that will cause houses built on its sands to fall. There is a hope with a foundation, and that hope is found in the death and resurrection of Jesus. That hope has a foundation because it has been demonstrated. Christ is Risen. ',\n",

Russell Freedman tells Marion's story in an easy to read, straightforward style that is accessible to even strugging readers. This book could be used as part of a unit teaching students about the civil rights movement, perhaps together with a music education class.\\nThough I enjoyed reading this book, I gave it a lower star ranking because I don't know that children will find it as compelling as adults do. This seems to me to be one of those books that adults think children should enjoy, but they really don't. Let's face it: few children are interested in or have even been exposed to opera, and it is an art form that requires a bit of maturity and patience to enjoy. I also think that there are other leaders of the civil rights movement whose life could better illustrate the time. \",\n",

This book revisits Dr Sara Linton, pediatrician &amp; medical examiner, and her ex-husband Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver as they investigate why a teenage girl would want to shot a teen boy. I like the town and characters that Slaughter creates. There are times when the subject matter of this book is difficult to read.

Finally, a list of various types of resources is given followed by an index.

I'm really glad I did, it has a lovely Linda Howard not so short story (about 110 pages) called Overload, about a man and a woman who get stuck in an office building during an electricity blackout (caused by heat for once, rather than Howard's more favored snowed in version) and it turns out they have a history... and so things go. I liked it because it shows that sometimes an alpha males strategies can back fire, and here he makes his recovery... fun and hot in the city.

       "  'comment': \"It's the first half of the trilogy's middle volume, and it's travelogue time. This is the section where many trilogies sag, but Brenchley paints a vivid picture of desert travel and its hardships and occasional delights. There's also another display of how very different this series is from standard fantasy derived from Northern European mythology, with the world of the djinn beautifully evoked.\\nThis volume gets the party from the Roc, where they met, to the place in the desert where they get to meet another major character, with some interesting diversions and scenery along the way. At the outset the party consists of Marron, Julianne and Elisande; Rudel and Redmond, the two Surayonese men; and Jemel, the young Sharai man introduced in volume 1 and briefly encountered in volume 2. The party have conflicting interests, not least because Marron and Elisande were involved in the death of Jemel's lover during the battle in the Roc, but they also have common interests and a common destination. That should be enough to keep the party together, but they aren't the only one with an interest in the supernatural burden Marron carries.\\nThat burden, the almost-living weapon known as the Daughter, showed the first of its secrets at the end of the previous volume; in the trek across the desert we learn more of what it can do and what it does to its host, and a little of what it actually is. Marron isn't the person anyone would have chosen to carry it, but proves equal to the task.\\nAnd again there are hints of various romantic interests and entanglements, without it being at all obvious how these will eventually be resolved. This segment of the story concludes with another twist of one of the romantic plotlines initiated in the first volume, enticing the reader to read on.\\nThis volume introduces more characters and adds new plot threads without concluding earlier ones, but it does expand on hints dropped in the earlier volumes, adding more depth to the world and the main characters. With the original book being split into two for the US edition, it should be seen as a segment in a long novel rather than a novel in its own right, and in that context offers enough to make for a satisfying read while still leaving the reader wanting to move on to the next volume. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Continuing with my at-random rereading of the Recluse books, Natural Ordermage is an interesting counterpoint to The Magic of Recluse. There are definite similarities - both feature somewhat self-obsessed young men who can't grasp the nature and responsibilities of their power, and get sent into exile to grow as people. But as novels, they're vastly different.\\nNatural Ordermage is a mature examination of some of the assumptions that underly the original social setup, using a new time period to explore some of the ways a society that values order above all else can go wrong - or right. Hamor, thus far the perpetual terrifying alien enemy, is now the sensibly-run, if far from democratic, society in contrast to the deeply corrupt Recluse.\\nRahl (and no, I have no idea if that's a nod to Terry Goodkind's work or not) starts off as a smug, whiny juvenile, and goes through some real transformation. I particularly enjoyed the idea that not everyone approached the system of magic from a highly intellectual place, and that people require pretty different pedagogical strategies in order to learn. (The contrast reminded me of the way people learn karate - some people scour the manual and keep a journal and think everything to death, and some people close their eyes and wave their arms around and eventually it just goes. And both strategies lead to the same place.)\\nI'm not rating it any more highly than Magic, although the writing is tremendously tighter and the plot of the novel is clearer and much more engaging. It lacks some of the wonder of the first book in a new world, and so they're fairly balanced. But I do like this one better. \",\n",

Beatrice, Bee for short, does not know how to deal with how her appearance is taken by others, so she has turned inward.

Bee must learn that independence and strength is all she needs to succeed and become a better person.\\nI loved this book, I did not want to get out the car (where I listen to my audiobooks). The storytelling was wonderful, from Bee's point of view, it was a combination of frustration, sadness, happiness, and stubbornness all rolled into one package, Bee.\\nThe author uses some fantasy, some history, and some playful takes on coping that were expressed well.\\nThe one issue that I had, was that I felt like a few things were left unresolved in the end. Bee is able to complete her journey, but in the process some loose ends were not cleared up.\\nI would recommend this book to anyone, Middle Grade readers and adults and teens who like contemporary reading.

Fra descrizioni pesanti e infinite e spesso ridondanti e noiose arriva un nipote, figlio della sorella fuggita da questa casa soffocante per il defunto padre dispotico (disonore! Vergogna! Grande vergogna la fuga, ancor pi grande vergogna il matrimonio con un semplice commerciante!). Ma Giacinto, il nipote, ha il vizio del gioco, e dopo debiti contratti con cambiali false fugge a Nuoro. Alle zie resta solo da pagare. Perdono l'ultimo podere loro rimasto, ma la zia pi giovane riceve una proposta di matrimonio da un ricco cugino, che orgogliosamente rifiuta per via di languidi sguardi ambigui col nipote. Per non portare il rifiuto della sua padrona, di cui Efix era ambasciatore, il servo decide di andare a cercare Giacinto, per dirgli di sposare una ragazza che ha fatto innamorare, per liberare la zia; poi va a fare il mendicante per espiare antiche colpe. Ma infine torna dalle sue padrone, e felice muore poco tempo dopo, avendo visto le cose ormai sistemate, e i matrimoni previsti combinati nella maniera pi opportuna.\\nIl titolo si riferisce all'impotenza dell'uomo di fronte al volere divino, che dispiega gli avvenimenti secondo un piano nascosto cui gli uomini non devono opporsi ma solo piegarsi.\\nNoioso, lento, passato ma di un passato narrato senza stimolare alcun interesse.

I know hes bad but I cant help but love him. Im still rooting for Carter as the man Georgina will end up with. Unlikely I know but I can hope right?\\nSuccubus Shadows contained lots and lots of Georgie flashbacks in the form of dreams. I think this book really helped me to understand where Richelle Mead is going with this series but also left me with many unanswered questions. Why is Carter so invested in Georginas life? What is up with the bond between Seth and Georgina? Why is Jerome obsessed with John Cusack ;) Ok Ill be serious now and try to give my opinion on this book without giving too much away. Its going to be hard because I have so many theories and ideas about what is happening bouncing around in my head.\\nIts disheartening to see how long Georgina has struggled with her role as succubus. She is quite the romantic at heart. Not a characteristic that normally goes hand in hand with someone who seduces men and steals their life force for a living. Her whole reason for becoming a succubus was so altruistic it doesnt seem fair she will spend an eternity as one of hells minions. Yes, Im aware that her poor choices led to her becoming a succubus but how many of us would sign our souls over to hell in order to fix something that hurt the ones we love?\\nFrom the flashbacks in this installment it really shows how Georgina seems to be reliving a recurring cycle so to speak. Continually being drawn to artsy (coincidence?) men that she cant be with for one reason or another. She has definitely experienced more than her share of heartbreak over the course of her immortal life.\\nThis book was definitely a fabulous addition to the Georgina Kincaid series. I cant believe there will only be one more book in this series and that we have to wait an entire year for it to be published. Waiting sucks! ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Falling in Controlled Circumstances by Pepper Espinoza\\nThis is the story of a menages, clear and simple.\\nGreg and Phil are in a long-term relationship, 2 years as lovers and another 2 years as committed partner. It\\'s a very good relationship, Greg a librarian, Phil a chief inspector for the local police department at Cambridge, England. Always seems perfect if not that lately Phil is pretty taken with his job, working odd shift. But Greg never has expressed any complaint, he is happy with their life; Phil is not a simple man to love, he is reserved and taciturn, but he is also very attentive; Greg feels cherished and protected when he is with his lover and on the other hand, Greg knows when his lover needs to be comforted and embraced in the warm arm of his lover and their house, to shut down the world outside.\\nThen arrives Jim, an American pilot who tests prototypes in the near Air base, recently moved on the neighbor. Jim is outspoken, friendly and handsome. And he has no problem to make clear to Greg that he finds him very attractive. Greg is not blind, and he can see all the good sides on Jim, but he really loves Phil and he would do nothing to compromise their relationship, neither a little kiss. And when at first Phil is sharp and detached toward Jim, Greg thinks that he can only offer a friendship to Jim, and better if the friendship arrives from both of them, Greg and Phil, without allowing to much private meeting between Greg and Jim. But then Phil\\'s behavior changes, he seems to push the boundaries of Greg\\'s fantasies, letting him imagine and taste how it could be with Jim and Phil together; not only that, Phil seems to desire that Greg builds something with Jim\\'s only, trying to imagine what it would be if Phil was not there with him...\\nIt\\'s not simple to read of Greg\\'s interest in Jim without reading it like a cheating on Phil, even if Phil is aware and consenting. There is never a moment in which Phil makes Greg feel guilty for what he feels for Jim, so I have not the feeling I used to when reading a menages, that one of the men is a cheater; but it\\'s also true that Greg remains the \"center\" man, the link between Phil and Jim. True, the author tries all the possible combination, Phil &amp; Greg, Phil &amp; Greg &amp; Jim, Greg &amp; Jim, Phil &amp; Jim, but she doesn\\'t linger when the three are not together, making so stronger the menages and not the simple couple.\\nThe feeling on the story is that Phil and Greg probably would be an happy couple also without Jim, Phil is the stronger man on whom Greg lean to, and Jim adds to the couple a new breeze, a bit of lightness, but probably Greg and Jim alone would not work out; for Greg, Jim would be a flirt, someone he could be happy for a bit, but not the man he would choose for a long-term relationship. In all this, Phil emerges as the master, the puppeteer of both Greg and Jim, but he reaches this rank without being nasty or aloof.\\nSins of the Past by Amanda Young\\nFirst of all... don\\'t get pissed of the mistery which was not a mistery. I don\\'t know if Amanda Young wants intentionally give us so much clue to unveal the hidden secret from the start, but she does that and so the big surprise you will have at the end of the book for me is not so big. \\nAnd so I have had the chance to indulge in something else, like the tender wooing Ryan starts with Andrew. Ryan and Andrew meet thanks to a blind date common friends organize. In the beginning Ryan thinks Andrew not to be his type: Andrew is rich and cultered, lives on previous accumulated wealthy and is a single father. Ryan is an exterior architect and has built his fortune by himself. He is a simple man and loves the handwork. And at thirtyone years old he has just stopped to cruising and maybe he is ready to start something serious, but a man with a little daughter? But Andrew is so nice and sexy... \\nI like both Ryan and Andrew. They are different, as different as can be white and black, but the sparks between them are hot. Ryan is the down-and-dirty soon type, Andrew is the quite and thinking one. Ryan is a Harley and denim type, Andrew a SUV and slacks one. But in bed they are very compatible and so, maybe, they can find a way to be together. \\nOne only regret: when Amanda Young has introduced the supporting character of Bobby, at the beginning of the story, how she has described him... well, I\\'m, for some moment, been a fan of him to be the main character of the book :-)\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1605047775/?tag=elimyrevandra-20',\n",

       "  'comment': \"American 10-year-old Elizabeth and her parents come to live in a small cottage in the west of England so her dad can do research in Hardy Country. Elizabeth is unsettled by it all. One day on a walk through the nearby wild woods she and her mother come across a pair of ancient derelict cottages. When Elizabeth returns there on her &nbsp;own later she discovers that, far from derelict, the cottages are athrob with life; further, the forest around them is far thicker than she remembers it being before . . .\\nShe eventually discovers that she has timeslipped back to 1871. There is a 10-year-old living in one of the cottages, Ann, and Ann alone of all her family knows that Elizabeth is there watching. When Elizabeth impulsively touches Ann, her identity flows into the other girl, and she is able to spend some time as a not-entirely-passive observer of Ann's life before running back through the wild woods and into the present. Needless to say, when she gets home she finds she hasn't been gone long.\\nSeveral times more Elizabeth journeys into the past to spend extended periods living within Ann's life. Finally, though, Ann's baby brother dies and Ann herself falls ill -- and, it seems certain, will soon join him. She chooses as a better option than this to come into the present and let her selfness flow into Elizabeth, the way Elizabeth's has so often flowed into her. For the rest of Elizabeth's life Ann will be, as it were, at the back of her mind.\\nThis is an extraordinarily charming tale, and in both telling and subtlety of concept an advance on Anderson's earlier In the Keep of Time. I do hope some wise publisher somewhere has the sense soon to bring it back into print; at the moment used copies are commanding moderately high prices on Amazon. (I was able to obtain my reading copy solely through New Jersey's inter-library loan system, shortly to be axed at the behest of NJ Governor Chris Christie, who's cutting the state's library budget by a completely insane 74%.) \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"I always enjoy reading a book I know nothing about. The slate is clean. I have no expectations--good or bad. It's a nice feeling to make up my mind about a book with little outside influence. Honestly, I don't do it enough.\\nStolen Horses was one of these reads. I'd never heard of it or its author until my MFA mentor recommended it to me. By the time I had a copy in hand, there were no forces pulling me one way or another aside from the singular recommendation.\\nIn spirit of this refreshing perspective, I probably shouldn't mention how good this book was. I probably shouldn't say that Stolen Horses was a simple, yet interesting read, or that the characters were very desirable to follow, even through their most trivial actions. And of course it would be a mistake to talk about how the end of the novel was a wonderful payoff.\\nOf course, if I said all those positive things, I would be in error not to mention some of the things I didn't like in this novel. It would, after all, only make it fair. For instance, I might mention how O'Brien's theme was a bit heavy-handed at times. Or how the novel's bad characters weren't likable enough. Or that O'Brien should leave similes alone--really, I mean that in the nicest way (see pgs. 130 and 135). All relatively minor issues, but ones which did distract from a completely enjoyable read.\\nThe problem is, if I say anything good about this book, then a reader who trusts my judgment will want to read it and be disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype. Then they'll never read another one of my reviews. And what will I do then? No, it's better to say nothing. Give the reader a blank slate.\\nSo... read any good books lately? \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Locker 13, the second book in R.L. Stein's Nightmare Room Series is something a bit different than the first book, which I felt was genuinely chilling and frightful. Both books (and I imagine the entire series, but I'm only on book #2, after all) open with a Twilight Zone-esque introduction, which I rather like. This particular volume focuses on Luke, who happens to be quite superstitious and not all that lucky. Rather than make his own way, he relies on his lucky shirt, lucky sandwich, lucky rabbits foot...he's got a lucky item for darn near every occasion! He's also fond of rubbing his lucky shirt 7 times and squeezing his rabbits foot in multiples of three for increased luck. His best friend is the luckiest person he knows...winning things, finding money, and just plain ol' lucky on a daily basis. \\nThe story follows Luke through the year, after the first day, when he is unlucky enough to be assigned locker 13...poor unlucky Luke...how will this unlucky start color his year? Read and find out. \\nLuke doesn't seem to see the world in terms of effort put out or innate skills...he sees it as having luck or not having it and if you haven't got it, he seems to think he's less than a zero. I find the whole story interesting and suspenseful, but not chilling or outright scary. This one is more of a moralistic tale...with a pretty standard moral tale ending...whereas the first book (Don't Forget Me) had a less straight forward ending (typical Twilight Zone, non-committal, open to more weirdness than solid closure for the story)...which is what I really liked about it, it introduces readers to the less than clear ending for story lines. This book is not like that, it has definite closure, though sitting here thinking about it...one could make a case for that not being entirely true, based on the penny incident at the very end. If that is the case, then the weirdness is more subtle in this second volume and that's cool too, though less sophisticated readers might not pick up on it (and clearly I almost fell into that category myself). \\nOverall, I liked it, though it's not as creepy as the first (for my taste), it is suspenseful and definitely an interesting story line. The main character could have been a little more developed, so we could more easily identify with him, but not bad at all! A fine addition to a budding line of creepy tales. It should be interesting to see where Stein goes with additional volumes! \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'If you suspect that you might be an ordinary person, one without creativity or imagination... well, then Stranger Things Happen might not appeal to you to begin with, but it certainly won\\'t make you feel any better about your imaginative state. Even if you think you are a fairly creative person, it\\'s hard to believe that you could come close the level of the fantastic and fascinating that Kelly Link achieves in these eleven short stories. A strange combination of fantasy and very modern reality, Link\\'s collection features stories that don\\'t necessarily always work perfectly, but are certainly memorable.\\nAs far as the collection goes, these stories are all linked by fairy tales (or mythology) undercurrents and an ethereal tone where the reader understands that not all is as it seems... and the fact that in each of these stories, very real characters (in perhaps not so realistic settings) deal with personal pain and try to somehow make a connection to someone else. On the back cover of my paperback, Andrew O\\'Hehir is quoted from his NY Times Book Review article as saying that Link\\'s stories \"aren\\'t linked to one another, at least not in the sense that they share settings or characters, but they all draw water from the same clear, cold, deep well.\" I find that to be a profoundly excellent way of explaining the feeling that one is left with at the end of the collection. Not quite ghost stories in a sense of horror, but certainly some blend of Gothic fantasy that yield goosebumps and an eerie atmosphere.\\nLink is a good example of the post-modern storyteller struggling to find a narrative structure that works for each tale, and as a result, few of these pieces are straightforward narratives. I tended to find that the more straightforward stories (well, as straightforward as Link gets) are the ones that I liked a bit more -- I was able to spend more time thinking about the characters and events and less in decoding her narrative intentions/figuring what she was trying to do by mixing things up so completely. (I\\'m mostly thinking about \"The Girl Detective\" as I say that, the last in the collection and, for me, the least satisfying.) There is, however, always a way to connect emotionally with these characters, for no matter how strange the circumstances of the story, it\\'s the deeper emotions that make up the truly compelling foundation of each one.\\nIt\\'s hard to pick a favorite -- and harder to single one out as being the most memorable -- but if I had to, I think I would go with \"Travels with the Snow Queen\" as the one I enjoyed most in the collection. Of course, I also feel that might be my shortfalls as a reader, because I found it very easy to relate to that narrator. As a young woman coming to terms with a failed relationship, she walks a path shown in the scars of her shoeless feet and whether she must stick to this path becomes an overpowering question. The reader is led to question the sacrifices of heroines in fairy tales and wonder if the traditional happily ever after with a \"hero\" is quite worth it or if the heroine might be just as happy pursing some other path. A close second is \"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,\" where a probably dead man exists in a somewhat limbo-like seaside resort, writing letters to his wife, whose name he cannot remember. The uncertainty of his situation and his clinging to what he believes he knows about his wife and their life paints a very poignant picture. As the first story in the book, it drew me in and assured that I would keep reading. \"Flying Lessons\" draws heavily on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (and even a bit of Icarus), but with some swapped gender roles, one feels a greater strength in the heroine so that ultimate happiness might just be possible. (Of course, there\\'s also the looming idea of what happens then, but one must first get to the point where one can seriously ask that question). \"Survivor\\'s Ball, or, the Donner Party\" features two Americans, strangers, that have decided to travel through New Zealand together for a bit. The narrator is a young man, obviously smitten with his traveling companion, and the girl is named Serena -- which led to me explicitly picturing Blake Lively in the role (as her character in Gossip Girl is also a selfish girl named Serena who easily attracts men and always gets her somewhat self-destructive way). They\\'re driving towards a particular hotel and the news is filled with talk over a missing party of hikers in a snowstorm. Clearly, we understand some implications that are drawn with the title, though the lack of specificity in the story allows the reader to imagine all kinds of interesting results. In \"Vanishing Act,\" a young girl is the only one paying close enough attention to watch her cousin slowly disappear (and aid her in that process) so she can rejoin her parents in faraway countries. One feels pain for this forgotten child, but even more painful is the situation of her cousin, watching a girl who seems to have some power to escape, whereas the cousin is stuck where she is, undeniably corporeal. \"Water off a Black Dog\\'s Back\" features a strange relationship between a young man whose relationship with a girl and her family seems to involve some bodily sacrifice and an acceptance of whatever nonhuman nature they might possess. \"Shoes and Marriage\" features for vignettes that focus on variations of Cinderella, a beauty pageant and Dorothy/her companions, Imelda Marcos (a dictator\\'s wife hoards the shoes of the people her husband has killed), and a fortune-teller\\'s predictions. With a common theme of shoes (and, well, marriage), I enjoyed all of the vignettes, but I\\'m not sure how well the piece worked as a whole. I didn\\'t much enjoy \"Most of My Friends Are Two-Thirds Water,\" where the narrator is hopelessly in love with a friend that doesn\\'t think much of her at all, beyond her usefulness as a person who will listen to him. He\\'s too preoccupied with the question of whether the women in the world are turning into aliens. \"Louise\\'s Ghost\" deals with two best friends named Louise, which made things challenging, but interesting, as Link was able to really play with the question of where they blended into the other and where they were decidedly distinct. \"The Girl Detective\" touches upon the fairy tale of the twelve dancing princesses and the idea of lost mothers. Unwittingly, I seem to have found an order of my favorites in this collection by describing them, but I\\'m also struck with the fact that, even though I had to look for some exact titles, I was able to remember every single story in the series without forgetting a one.\\nI took my time in reading Stranger Things Happen, keeping it for subway rides so I could swallow it in small bites and frequently pause to consider the ideas at play. At moments, I would have no idea where Link was taking us or why -- and at others, I felt profoundly moved. I\\'m fairly sure that some alchemy is at play in her words where it\\'s possible for two people to read the exact same Link story and yet come out with completely different experiences and understandings of what happened. Link trusts the reader to draw his or her own conclusions, and often, that\\'s what yields a spookier result. She\\'s not afraid of open-ended ideas that have no precise answer. Several stories end without a single resolution, and so the reader is left to imagine all kinds of results. While the stories themselves might be open for interpretation, I find that one thing is certain: Kelly Link is a master of the short story. ',\n",

Victim-blaming was rife through the story.

The 'romance' between them was built on dependence and desperation and gratitude rather than an actual connection and emotion and the skeeviness of it made me want to shower rather than coo, tbh.

They blame Hancock for their mother\\'s death and have been waiting a long time for him to return to his family\\'s homestead on the lake. Hancock has a fear of water, so to lure him in, Calder sets out to seduce Hancock\\'s daughter, Lily. Easy enoughespecially as Calder has lots of practice using his irresistable good looks and charm on ususpecting girls. Only this time Calder screws everything up: he falls for Lilyjust as Lily starts to suspect that there\\'s more to the monsters-in-the-lake legends than she ever imagined. And just as his sisters are losing patience with him. (Synopsis provided by goodreads)\\nMy first thought when I heard about this book, was holy cow awesome! My feeling of glee was depleted rather quickly. It wasn\\'t at all what I was hoping for. I wanted to know more about the mermaids in this novel. What was their history? Why are they the way they are? What\\'s the bottom line?\\nMy main issue was the stalking. Yes, stalking. In YA there seems to be a lot of it. There are also books where it seems like stalking, but it isn\\'t. When the stalker is hiding, and watching your every move it\\'s stalking. It\\'s not sweet, it\\'s not romantic, it\\'s illegal all over. \\nNow, I\\'m the type of girl where I don\\'t want to be stalked, call me crazy, but yeah stalking is a major turn off. \\nThe fact that these mermaids \"feed\" by zapping humans of emotions felt a lot like dementors in Harry Potter. I\\'m fine with similar things in books, because lets be honest any and all paranormal books have similarities. That\\'s fine, but originality goes a long way.\\nIt was very predictable to me and there were just too many creepy quotes in the book. Not creepy in the Stephen King holy-cow-that-is-creepy-I-want-to-sleep-with-the-lights-on way but the eww-what-a- creepy- person sort of way.\\nThe writing style apart from the creepy quotes wasn\\'t bad. But it also wasn\\'t a book I couldn\\'t put down. \\nFor me this book is one I\\'ll forget in a month or so and I don\\'t think I\\'ll be continuing the series. \\nPlease don\\'t let my opinion alone determine if you\\'re going to read it or not, check out some more favorable reviews as well.

       "  'comment': \"My recomendation to anyone starting on the Patrick O'Brian series is simple: wait at least three books. If you're not willing to give a twenty book (and then some) epic a good chance, then you won't finish it anyway. It's a rule which has helped me time and again in introducing unsuspecting friends to the wonders of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. \\nEven after reading the series, this is and remains my favorite Aubrey-Maturin book. It contains both highs and lows, some of the funniest moments, animal misadventures, and truly daring battles, but also the personal depth and emotion which defines this series and makes it greater than simply 'naval fiction'. \",\n",

       "  'comment': \"Now that Max is back from his mission in europe with his time, he feels its time to settle down, get married and have a family, especially after giving the majority of his life in service to his country. At first he has a list of potential future wives that would suit his needs, that is, until he see's Daphne Starling, and he knows that she will be His. Even though Daphne has recently been jilted, he is drawn to her in a way that even he can't explain to himself. Daphne, has recently nearly been ruined by a past suitor, and she doesn't know what her future holds, until she meets the Marquess of Rotherstone, who is very charming and seductive, and she knows she could easily fall under his spell, and although they share an intimacy she has never known, she just doesn't know if she can trust him, when she knows he is hiding something from her......Since I have been reading the series out of order, I have been wanting to read Max's story, and I was so glad that I did. The only real negative aspect of the story...was that it took a bit to get into the book, but once I did I was really into it, and it was just as fun and enticing as Foley's other works. It was interesting to see Max develop in the story, much more than we see Daphne develop. Max has alot against him, much of which he kinda does to himself a bit, but it was neat to see him change from a sexy but aloof and withdrawn man, to someone that is what Daphne really needs. Another aspect that I really liked was the way Max and Daphne connected, very intense and sensual yet had a perfect balance of excitement and romance to even it all out...a very enjoyable read! \",\n",

       "  'comment': 'What could be more invasive than the horror of having your mind invaded, your home intruded upon, and your world suddenly turned into a very different place? What if you began to see things that others couldn\\'t see, and you began to behave in ways far different from your normal behavior? Katharine Geryon is a daughter of privilege, trained as a corporate executive in her father\\'s successful investment firm. All her life, she has known her place, her future seemingly secure and etched in stone. Her life\\'s foundation is shaken to the core when she begins to have other-worldly visitors in the form of strange animals which appear in her apartment and leave piles of soot behind when they vanish. Strange messages in Latin are left on her bathroom mirror, giving her the feeling that no part of life is without vulnerability. In \"God\\'s Eye\", A.J. Scudiere skillfully weaves a tale of a woman\\'s struggle to survive as a demon and an angel war with each other over the conquest of her very soul. Good or evil? Who\\'s the good guy and who\\'s the devil? Both so handsomely packaged and so seductively charming--how to tell which one to choose? It becomes very clear to Katharine that she must make a choice. A life-altering choice with long-lasting effects, not just for her life, but for the lives of many others. The author fleshes out the paranormal thriller story line with passion and depth and interesting, intriguing cultural and business insights. She gives us a heroine to root for as we watch Katharine\\'s character growth while the ground under her feet turns to shifting sand. The resolution is unexpected and ultimately satisfying. I very much look forward to reading more involving works from the imagination of A.J. Scudiere! \\nReview Copy Gratis Griffyn Ink ',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Its so tough to be ten-years-old. Nobody knows this better than Nate. He has to put up with his bossy big sister and listening to his fathers never  ending stories about when he was growing up. Not only this, but his mother doesnt know how to cook. She thinks she does and even makes meals for Nate and his family. The problem is, all the meals taste like cardboard! To make matters even worse, the teacher pairs him up to do a science project with a (ugh!) girl.\\nOn Christmas morning, Nates world seems to look up when he and his sister get a small package. The family is going on a trip. Is his bossy sister happy about this? No. She whines and complains how she has nothing to wear on the trip and has to work on her tan before they hit the beach. \\nSo, how does Nate escape the atrocities of his life? Drawing! Give Nate a sketch pad, pencils, crayons and Nates imagination can take him anywhere, do anything and most importantly, do it his way. In practically every chapter Nates imagination takes him on another adventure. He also has a way to get out of eating his moms cooking. The problem is that this only works some of the time. Nate plays with his best friend and hopes he is invited for dinner. \\nI just loved this book! Karen P. Toz shows all of the trials and imaginative solutions of a ten-year-old boy perfectly.\\nTo learn more about Karen, just surf over to her website at: http://karentoz.com.

I wasn't at all put off, she treats the nuts and bolts of the alimentary canal as tactfully as she did sex, ghosts and corpses in previous books. Roach is informative throughout and this book is a pleasure to read because of her earthy humor and grounding in the realities of everyday life.

       "  'comment': 'NCLA Review - A previous version of this novel was published in 1998 under the title: The Heather and the Thistle. When her father devises a plan to free Mary, Queen of Scots, Heather Graham does not foresee being the key to its success. Yet, loyalty to her Queen finds Heather devoting her time to teaching a Highlander, Duncan Armstrong, the behavior of an English fop. Heathers initial loathing for Duncan turns to a respect and then blossoming love. As danger looms nearer, Heather and Duncan realize how fragile love can be. Kathleen Morgan has crafted fiery and passionate characters willing to fight for what they believe in even when the odds are against them. This well-written story will certainly captivate the readers attention. The authors careful research into this period of Scottish history is clearly evident throughout this historical novel.

The beginning was really good but towards the end it slowed down. I loved the characters, and how the author switched their stories every other chapter. The story plot and setting were amazingly unique. The ending was very surprising and left you wondering if there would be a sequel. The only complaints I have with the book is at points it was a little confusing, and I wish the ending was as good as the beginning. It's not for sure but I have read that this book will be the first of the trilogy. The Midnight Charter is David Whitley's first book, and I look forward to read other things by him. \",\n",
